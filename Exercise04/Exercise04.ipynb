Limited\\n                         38 Great Russell Street\\nCHAPTER I—START IN LIFE\\nI was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family,\\nthough not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who\\nsettled first at Hull.  He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving\\noff his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my\\nmother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that\\ncountry, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the\\nusual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call\\nourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called\\nme.\\nI had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an\\nEnglish regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous\\nColonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the\\nSpaniards.  What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than\\nmy father or mother knew what became of me.\\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head\\nbegan to be filled very early with rambling thoughts.  My father, who was\\nvery ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as\\nhouse-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me\\nfor the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and\\nmy inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the\\ncommands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of\\nmy mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in\\nthat propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which\\nwas to befall me.\\nMy father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel\\nagainst what he foresaw was my design.  He called me one morning into his\\nchamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly\\nwith me upon this subject.  He asked me what reasons, more than a mere\\nwandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my native\\ncountry, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising\\nmy fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.\\nHe told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring,\\nsuperior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise\\nby enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out\\nof the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or\\ntoo far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called\\nthe upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience,\\nwas the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not\\nexposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the\\nmechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,\\nambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.  He told me I might\\njudge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was\\nthe state of life which all other people envied; that kings have\\nfrequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great\\nthings, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two\\nextremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his\\ntestimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have\\nneither poverty nor riches.\\nHe bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of\\nlife were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the\\nmiddle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many\\nvicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not\\nsubjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,\\nas those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the\\none hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or\\ninsufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by\\nthe natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station\\nof life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments;\\nthat peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that\\ntemperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable\\ndiversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the\\nmiddle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly\\nthrough the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the\\nlabours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for\\ndaily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the\\nsoul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy,\\nor the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy\\ncircumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the\\nsweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and\\nlearning by every day’s experience to know it more sensibly.\\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner,\\nnot to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which\\nnature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided\\nagainst; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would\\ndo well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life\\nwhich he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very\\neasy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must\\nhinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus\\ndischarged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be\\nto my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I\\nwould stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so\\nmuch hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away;\\nand to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to\\nwhom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into\\nthe Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting\\nhim to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he\\nwould not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that\\nif I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should\\nhave leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when\\nthere might be none to assist in my recovery.\\nI observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic,\\nthough I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself—I say, I\\nobserved the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he\\nspoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having\\nleisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke\\noff the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more\\nto me.\\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be\\notherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to\\nsettle at home according to my father’s desire.  But alas! a few days\\nwore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further\\nimportunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from\\nhim.  However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my\\nresolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a\\nlittle more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so\\nentirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to\\nanything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had\\nbetter give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now\\neighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or\\nclerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out\\nmy time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time\\nwas out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go\\none voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go\\nno more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time\\nthat I had lost.\\nThis put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be\\nto no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew\\ntoo well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for\\nmy hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after\\nthe discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender\\nexpressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if\\nI would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I\\nshould never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not\\nhave so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say\\nthat my mother was willing when my father was not.\\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards\\nthat she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after\\nshowing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might\\nbe happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the\\nmost miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”\\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in\\nthe meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling\\nto business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about\\ntheir being so positively determined against what they knew my\\ninclinations prompted me to.  But being one day at Hull, where I went\\ncasually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time;\\nbut, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to\\nLondon in his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them with the\\ncommon allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my\\npassage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as\\nsent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might,\\nwithout asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without any consideration\\nof circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the\\n1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London.  Never\\nany young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued\\nlonger than mine.  The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind\\nbegan to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I\\nhad never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and\\nterrified in mind.  I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had\\ndone, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my\\nwicked leaving my father’s house, and abandoning my duty.  All the good\\ncounsels of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s entreaties,\\ncame now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to\\nthe pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the\\ncontempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.\\nAll this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though\\nnothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few\\ndays after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young\\nsailor, and had never known anything of the matter.  I expected every\\nwave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down,\\nas I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never\\nrise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that\\nif it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got\\nonce my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father,\\nand never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his\\nadvice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.  Now I\\nsaw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of\\nlife, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had\\nbeen exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that\\nI would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.\\nThese wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted,\\nand indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the\\nsea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very\\ngrave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards\\nnight the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming\\nfine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the\\nnext morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun\\nshining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that\\never I saw.\\nI had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very\\ncheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible\\nthe day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time\\nafter.  And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion,\\nwho had enticed me away, comes to me; “Well, Bob,” says he, clapping me\\nupon the shoulder, “how do you do after it?  I warrant you were frighted,\\nwer’n’t you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?”  “A capful\\nd’you call it?” said I; “’twas a terrible storm.”  “A storm, you fool\\nyou,” replies he; “do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all;\\ngive us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a\\nsquall of wind as that; but you’re but a fresh-water sailor, Bob.  Come,\\nlet us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that; d’ye see what\\ncharming weather ’tis now?”  To make short this sad part of my story, we\\nwent the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was made half drunk\\nwith it: and in that one night’s wickedness I drowned all my repentance,\\nall my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the\\nfuture.  In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface\\nand settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my\\nthoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by\\nthe sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I\\nentirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress.  I\\nfound, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts\\ndid, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them\\noff, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and\\napplying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of\\nthose fits—for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as\\ncomplete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not\\nto be troubled with it could desire.  But I was to have another trial for\\nit still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to\\nleave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a\\ndeliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened\\nwretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.\\nThe sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind\\nhaving been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way\\nsince the storm.  Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we\\nlay, the wind continuing contrary—viz. at south-west—for seven or eight\\ndays, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the\\nsame Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind\\nfor the river.\\nWe had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up the\\nriver, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four or\\nfive days, blew very hard.  However, the Roads being reckoned as good as\\na harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men\\nwere unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent\\nthe time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth\\nday, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to\\nstrike our topmasts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship\\nmight ride as easy as possible.  By noon the sea went very high indeed,\\nand our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought\\nonce or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out\\nthe sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables\\nveered out to the bitter end.\\nBy this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see\\nterror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves.  The\\nmaster, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he\\nwent in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself\\nsay, several times, “Lord be merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we\\nshall be all undone!” and the like.  During these first hurries I was\\nstupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot\\ndescribe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so\\napparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I thought the\\nbitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like\\nthe first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now,\\nand said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted.  I got up out\\nof my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea\\nran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; when I\\ncould look about, I could see nothing but distress round us; two ships\\nthat rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep\\nladen; and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of\\nus was foundered.  Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were\\nrun out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast\\nstanding.  The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in\\nthe sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running\\naway with only their spritsail out before the wind.\\nTowards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to\\nlet them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but\\nthe boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would\\nfounder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the\\nmain-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged\\nto cut that away also, and make a clear deck.\\nAny one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but\\na young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little.\\nBut if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that\\ntime, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former\\nconvictions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had\\nwickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to\\nthe terror of the storm, put me into such a condition that I can by no\\nwords describe it.  But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued\\nwith such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never\\nseen a worse.  We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed\\nin the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would\\nfounder.  It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what\\nthey meant by _founder_ till I inquired.  However, the storm was so\\nviolent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain,\\nand some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and\\nexpecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom.  In the\\nmiddle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the\\nmen that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a leak; another\\nsaid there was four feet water in the hold.  Then all hands were called\\nto the pump.  At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within me: and I\\nfell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin.\\nHowever, the men roused me, and told me that I, that was able to do\\nnothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which I stirred\\nup and went to the pump, and worked very heartily.  While this was doing\\nthe master, seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the\\nstorm were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would come near us,\\nordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress.  I, who knew nothing what\\nthey meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened.\\nIn a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon.  As this was a\\ntime when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or\\nwhat was become of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and\\nthrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead;\\nand it was a great while before I came to myself.\\nWe worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that\\nthe ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet\\nit was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port; so\\nthe master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid\\nit out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.  It was with the\\nutmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get\\non board, or for the boat to lie near the ship’s side, till at last the\\nmen rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men\\ncast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out\\na great length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold of,\\nand we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat.\\nIt was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think\\nof reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to\\npull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our master promised\\nthem, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to\\ntheir master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to\\nthe northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.\\nWe were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we\\nsaw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by\\na ship foundering in the sea.  I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to\\nlook up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that\\nthey rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go in, my\\nheart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with\\nhorror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.\\nWhile we were in this condition—the men yet labouring at the oar to bring\\nthe boat near the shore—we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves,\\nwe were able to see the shore) a great many people running along the\\nstrand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow way\\ntowards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being past\\nthe lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards\\nCromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind.\\nHere we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on\\nshore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate\\nmen, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the\\ntown, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and\\nowners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to\\nLondon or back to Hull as we thought fit.\\nHad I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I\\nhad been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour’s parable, had\\neven killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in\\nwas cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any\\nassurances that I was not drowned.\\nBut my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could\\nresist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my\\nmore composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it.  I know\\nnot what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling\\ndecree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,\\neven though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.\\nCertainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was\\nimpossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the\\ncalm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against\\ntwo such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.\\nMy comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the master’s\\nson, was now less forward than I.  The first time he spoke to me after we\\nwere at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were\\nseparated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw\\nme, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and\\nshaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who I\\nwas, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go\\nfurther abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned\\ntone “Young man,” says he, “you ought never to go to sea any more; you\\nought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a\\nseafaring man.”  “Why, sir,” said I, “will you go to sea no more?”  “That\\nis another case,” said he; “it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but\\nas you made this voyage on trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given\\nyou of what you are to expect if you persist.  Perhaps this has all\\nbefallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.  Pray,”\\ncontinues he, “what are you; and on what account did you go to sea?”\\nUpon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out\\ninto a strange kind of passion: “What had I done,” says he, “that such an\\nunhappy wretch should come into my ship?  I would not set my foot in the\\nsame ship with thee again for a thousand pounds.”  This indeed was, as I\\nsaid, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense\\nof his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go.\\nHowever, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back\\nto my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see\\na visible hand of Heaven against me.  “And, young man,” said he, “depend\\nupon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with\\nnothing but disasters and disappointments, till your father’s words are\\nfulfilled upon you.”\\nWe parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no\\nmore; which way he went I knew not.  As for me, having some money in my\\npocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road,\\nhad many struggles with myself what course of life I should take, and\\nwhether I should go home or to sea.\\nAs to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my\\nthoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at\\namong the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and\\nmother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often\\nobserved, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is,\\nespecially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such\\ncases—viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to\\nrepent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be\\nesteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make\\nthem be esteemed wise men.\\nIn this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what\\nmeasures to take, and what course of life to lead.  An irresistible\\nreluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed away a while, the\\nremembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated,\\nthe little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till at\\nlast I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.\\nCHAPTER II—SLAVERY AND ESCAPE\\nThat evil influence which carried me first away from my father’s\\nhouse—which hurried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my\\nfortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make\\nme deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even the commands\\nof my father—I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented the\\nmost unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a\\nvessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly called\\nit, a voyage to Guinea.\\nIt was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not ship\\nmyself as a sailor; when, though I might indeed have worked a little\\nharder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should have learnt the duty\\nand office of a fore-mast man, and in time might have qualified myself\\nfor a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master.  But as it was always my\\nfate to choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my\\npocket and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the\\nhabit of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, nor\\nlearned to do any.\\nIt was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company in London,\\nwhich does not always happen to such loose and misguided young fellows as\\nI then was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for them\\nvery early; but it was not so with me.  I first got acquainted with the\\nmaster of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having had\\nvery good success there, was resolved to go again.  This captain taking a\\nfancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time,\\nhearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the\\nvoyage with him I should be at no expense; I should be his messmate and\\nhis companion; and if I could carry anything with me, I should have all\\nthe advantage of it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet\\nwith some encouragement.\\nI embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship with this\\ncaptain, who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with\\nhim, and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested\\nhonesty of my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for I\\ncarried about £40 in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to\\nbuy.  These £40 I had mustered together by the assistance of some of my\\nrelations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe, got my father, or\\nat least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.\\nThis was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my\\nadventures, which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the\\ncaptain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics\\nand the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship’s\\ncourse, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some things\\nthat were needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight\\nto instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made\\nme both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine\\nounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my\\nreturn, almost £300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts\\nwhich have since so completed my ruin.\\nYet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particularly, that I\\nwas continually sick, being thrown into a violent calenture by the\\nexcessive heat of the climate; our principal trading being upon the\\ncoast, from latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line itself.\\nI was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great\\nmisfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same\\nvoyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate\\nin the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship.  This was\\nthe unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry\\nquite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had £200 left, which I had\\nlodged with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into\\nterrible misfortunes.  The first was this: our ship making her course\\ntowards the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and the\\nAfrican shore, was surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish\\nrover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make.\\nWe crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts\\ncarry, to get clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and would\\ncertainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship\\nhaving twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen.  About three in the afternoon\\nhe came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our\\nquarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight\\nof our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon him,\\nwhich made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring in\\nalso his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on board.\\nHowever, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close.  He\\nprepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves.  But laying us\\non board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon\\nour decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and\\nrigging.  We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and\\nsuch like, and cleared our deck of them twice.  However, to cut short\\nthis melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of\\nour men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were\\ncarried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.\\nThe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended; nor\\nwas I carried up the country to the emperor’s court, as the rest of our\\nmen were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize,\\nand made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business.  At\\nthis surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a\\nmiserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon\\nmy father’s prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable and\\nhave none to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought\\nto pass that I could not be worse; for now the hand of Heaven had\\novertaken me, and I was undone without redemption; but, alas! this was\\nbut a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the\\nsequel of this story.\\nAs my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was in\\nhopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again, believing\\nthat it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or\\nPortugal man-of-war; and that then I should be set at liberty.  But this\\nhope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me on\\nshore to look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of\\nslaves about his house; and when he came home again from his cruise, he\\nordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.\\nHere I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take to\\neffect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it; nothing\\npresented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to\\ncommunicate it to that would embark with me—no fellow-slave, no\\nEnglishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that for two\\nyears, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never\\nhad the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.\\nAfter about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put\\nthe old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.\\nMy patron lying at home longer than usual without fitting out his ship,\\nwhich, as I heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or\\ntwice a week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take the\\nship’s pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always took\\nme and young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very merry,\\nand I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he\\nwould send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth—the Maresco,\\nas they called him—to catch a dish of fish for him.\\nIt happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog rose\\nso thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we lost\\nsight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we laboured all\\nday, and all the next night; and when the morning came we found we had\\npulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were\\nat least two leagues from the shore.  However, we got well in again,\\nthough with a great deal of labour and some danger; for the wind began to\\nblow pretty fresh in the morning; but we were all very hungry.\\nBut our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of\\nhimself for the future; and having lying by him the longboat of our\\nEnglish ship that he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any\\nmore without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of\\nhis ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or\\ncabin, in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place\\nto stand behind it to steer, and haul home the main-sheet; the room\\nbefore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.  She sailed with\\nwhat we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail; and the boom jibed over the top\\nof the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to\\nlie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers\\nto put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink; and his\\nbread, rice, and coffee.\\nWe went frequently out with this boat a-fishing; and as I was most\\ndexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me.  It happened\\nthat he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for\\nfish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for\\nwhom he had provided extraordinarily, and had, therefore, sent on board\\nthe boat overnight a larger store of provisions than ordinary; and had\\nordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and shot, which were on\\nboard his ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as\\nfishing.\\nI got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning\\nwith the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and everything\\nto accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on board alone,\\nand told me his guests had put off going from some business that fell\\nout, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the\\nboat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his\\nhouse, and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it\\nhome to his house; all which I prepared to do.\\nThis moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts, for\\nnow I found I was likely to have a little ship at my command; and my\\nmaster being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing\\nbusiness, but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as\\nconsider, whither I should steer—anywhere to get out of that place was my\\ndesire.\\nMy first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to get\\nsomething for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not\\npresume to eat of our patron’s bread.  He said that was true; so he\\nbrought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, and three jars of fresh water,\\ninto the boat.  I knew where my patron’s case of bottles stood, which it\\nwas evident, by the make, were taken out of some English prize, and I\\nconveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had\\nbeen there before for our master.  I conveyed also a great lump of\\nbeeswax into the boat, which weighed about half a hundred-weight, with a\\nparcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which\\nwere of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make candles.\\nAnother trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into also: his\\nname was Ismael, which they call Muley, or Moely; so I called to\\nhim—“Moely,” said I, “our patron’s guns are on board the boat; can you\\nnot get a little powder and shot?  It may be we may kill some alcamies (a\\nfowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner’s\\nstores in the ship.”  “Yes,” says he, “I’ll bring some;” and accordingly\\nhe brought a great leather pouch, which held a pound and a half of\\npowder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had five or six\\npounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat.  At the same time I\\nhad found some powder of my master’s in the great cabin, with which I\\nfilled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty,\\npouring what was in it into another; and thus furnished with everything\\nneedful, we sailed out of the port to fish.  The castle, which is at the\\nentrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us; and we\\nwere not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and\\nset us down to fish.  The wind blew from the N.N.E., which was contrary\\nto my desire, for had it blown southerly I had been sure to have made the\\ncoast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my\\nresolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from that\\nhorrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate.\\nAfter we had fished some time and caught nothing—for when I had fish on\\nmy hook I would not pull them up, that he might not see them—I said to\\nthe Moor, “This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we must\\nstand farther off.”  He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in the head\\nof the boat, set the sails; and, as I had the helm, I ran the boat out\\nnear a league farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish; when,\\ngiving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and\\nmaking as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise\\nwith my arm under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the sea.\\nHe rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to\\nbe taken in, told me he would go all over the world with me.  He swam so\\nstrong after the boat that he would have reached me very quickly, there\\nbeing but little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and fetching\\none of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him I had done\\nhim no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none.  “But,” said\\nI, “you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the sea is calm; make\\nthe best of your way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you come\\nnear the boat I’ll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to have\\nmy liberty;” so he turned himself about, and swam for the shore, and I\\nmake no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent\\nswimmer.\\nI could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have\\ndrowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him.  When he was\\ngone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, “Xury,\\nif you will be faithful to me, I’ll make you a great man; but if you will\\nnot stroke your face to be true to me”—that is, swear by Mahomet and his\\nfather’s beard—“I must throw you into the sea too.”  The boy smiled in my\\nface, and spoke so innocently that I could not distrust him, and swore to\\nbe faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.\\nWhile I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly\\nto sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might\\nthink me gone towards the Straits’ mouth (as indeed any one that had been\\nin their wits must have been supposed to do): for who would have supposed\\nwe were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where\\nwhole nations of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes and\\ndestroy us; where we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by\\nsavage beasts, or more merciless savages of human kind.\\nBut as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and\\nsteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little towards\\nthe east, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair, fresh\\ngale of wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by\\nthe next day, at three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made the\\nland, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of\\nSallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions, or indeed of any\\nother king thereabouts, for we saw no people.\\nYet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful\\napprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop,\\nor go on shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I had\\nsailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the\\nsouthward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase of\\nme, they also would now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,\\nand came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what,\\nnor where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what\\nriver.  I neither saw, nor desired to see any people; the principal thing\\nI wanted was fresh water.  We came into this creek in the evening,\\nresolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the\\ncountry; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises\\nof the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not\\nwhat kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of\\nme not to go on shore till day.  “Well, Xury,” said I, “then I won’t; but\\nit may be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those\\nlions.”  “Then we give them the shoot gun,” says Xury, laughing, “make\\nthem run wey.”  Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.\\nHowever, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram\\n(out of our patron’s case of bottles) to cheer him up.  After all, Xury’s\\nadvice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little anchor, and lay\\nstill all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in two or three\\nhours we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many\\nsorts, come down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing and\\nwashing themselves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made\\nsuch hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.\\nXury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we were both\\nmore frighted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming\\ntowards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his\\nblowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast.  Xury said it was a\\nlion, and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to\\nweigh the anchor and row away; “No,” says I, “Xury; we can slip our\\ncable, with the buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us\\nfar.”  I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it\\nwas) within two oars’ length, which something surprised me; however, I\\nimmediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at\\nhim; upon which he immediately turned about and swam towards the shore\\nagain.\\nBut it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries and\\nhowlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher\\nwithin the country, upon the noise or report of the gun, a thing I have\\nsome reason to believe those creatures had never heard before: this\\nconvinced me that there was no going on shore for us in the night on that\\ncoast, and how to venture on shore in the day was another question too;\\nfor to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages had been as bad\\nas to have fallen into the hands of the lions and tigers; at least we\\nwere equally apprehensive of the danger of it.\\nBe that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other\\nfor water, for we had not a pint left in the boat; when and where to get\\nto it was the point.  Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one\\nof the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring some to me.\\nI asked him why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the\\nboat?  The boy answered with so much affection as made me love him ever\\nafter.  Says he, “If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey.”  “Well,\\nXury,” said I, “we will both go and if the wild mans come, we will kill\\nthem, they shall eat neither of us.”  So I gave Xury a piece of rusk\\nbread to eat, and a dram out of our patron’s case of bottles which I\\nmentioned before; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we\\nthought was proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms\\nand two jars for water.\\nI did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of\\ncanoes with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place about\\na mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-by I saw him come\\nrunning towards me.  I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted\\nwith some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him; but when\\nI came nearer to him I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which\\nwas a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour,\\nand longer legs; however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good\\nmeat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had\\nfound good water and seen no wild mans.\\nBut we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for a\\nlittle higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when\\nthe tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our\\njars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on our\\nway, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the\\ncountry.\\nAs I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that the\\nislands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands also, lay not far\\noff from the coast.  But as I had no instruments to take an observation\\nto know what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least\\nremembering, what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for\\nthem, or when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now\\neasily have found some of these islands.  But my hope was, that if I\\nstood along this coast till I came to that part where the English traded,\\nI should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade,\\nthat would relieve and take us in.\\nBy the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that\\ncountry which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the\\nnegroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes\\nhaving abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and the\\nMoors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness; and\\nindeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers,\\nlions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour there; so that\\nthe Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, two\\nor three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a hundred miles\\ntogether upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited country\\nby day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by\\nnight.\\nOnce or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe, being\\nthe high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great\\nmind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having tried\\ntwice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too\\nhigh for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first design, and\\nkeep along the shore.\\nSeveral times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left\\nthis place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to an\\nanchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the tide\\nbeginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in.  Xury, whose eyes were\\nmore about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me\\nthat we had best go farther off the shore; “For,” says he, “look, yonder\\nlies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.”  I\\nlooked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a\\nterrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade\\nof a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him.  “Xury,”\\nsays I, “you shall on shore and kill him.”  Xury, looked frighted, and\\nsaid, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant.  However,\\nI said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our biggest\\ngun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of\\npowder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun\\nwith two bullets; and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with\\nfive smaller bullets.  I took the best aim I could with the first piece\\nto have shot him in the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little\\nabove his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the\\nbone.  He started up, growling at first, but finding his leg broken, fell\\ndown again; and then got upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar\\nthat ever I heard.  I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on\\nthe head; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and though he\\nbegan to move off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the\\npleasure to see him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling\\nfor life.  Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.\\n“Well, go,” said I: so the boy jumped into the water and taking a little\\ngun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to\\nthe creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the\\nhead again, which despatched him quite.\\nThis was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry to\\nlose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for\\nnothing to us.  However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes\\non board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.  “For what, Xury?” said\\nI.  “Me cut off his head,” said he.  However, Xury could not cut off his\\nhead, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a\\nmonstrous great one.\\nI bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one way\\nor other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin if\\nI could.  So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the\\nbetter workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.  Indeed, it took\\nus both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and\\nspreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two\\ndays’ time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.\\nCHAPTER III—WRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND\\nAfter this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or\\ntwelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to\\nabate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged\\nto for fresh water.  My design in this was to make the river Gambia or\\nSenegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verde, where I was in\\nhopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what\\ncourse I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there among\\nthe negroes.  I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either\\nto the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this\\ncape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune\\nupon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship or must\\nperish.\\nWhen I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said,\\nI began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three places,\\nas we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us; we\\ncould also perceive they were quite black and naked.  I was once inclined\\nto have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and\\nsaid to me, “No go, no go.”  However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I\\nmight talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good\\nway.  I observed they had no weapons in their hand, except one, who had a\\nlong slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they could\\nthrow them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked\\nwith them by signs as well as I could; and particularly made signs for\\nsomething to eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would\\nfetch me some meat.  Upon this I lowered the top of my sail and lay by,\\nand two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half-an-hour\\ncame back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn,\\nsuch as is the produce of their country; but we neither knew what the one\\nor the other was; however, we were willing to accept it, but how to come\\nat it was our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and\\nthey were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for\\nthey brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great\\nway off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.\\nWe made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends;\\nbut an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;\\nfor while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures, one\\npursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains\\ntowards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or whether\\nthey were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could\\ntell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;\\nbecause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but\\nin the night; and, in the second place, we found the people terribly\\nfrighted, especially the women.  The man that had the lance or dart did\\nnot fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran\\ndirectly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the\\nnegroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they\\nhad come for their diversion; at last one of them began to come nearer\\nour boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had\\nloaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the\\nothers.  As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him\\ndirectly in the head; immediately he sank down into the water, but rose\\ninstantly, and plunged up and down, as if he were struggling for life,\\nand so indeed he was; he immediately made to the shore; but between the\\nwound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he\\ndied just before he reached the shore.\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at\\nthe noise and fire of my gun: some of them were even ready to die for\\nfear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the\\ncreature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to\\ncome to the shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for the\\ncreature.  I found him by his blood staining the water; and by the help\\nof a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they\\ndragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious leopard,\\nspotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held up their\\nhands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.\\nThe other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the\\ngun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they\\ncame; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was.  I found quickly\\nthe negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to\\nhave them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made signs to them\\nthat they might take him, they were very thankful for.  Immediately they\\nfell to work with him; and though they had no knife, yet, with a\\nsharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more\\nreadily, than we could have done with a knife.  They offered me some of\\nthe flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would give it them; but\\nmade signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me a\\ngreat deal more of their provisions, which, though I did not understand,\\nyet I accepted.  I then made signs to them for some water, and held out\\none of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was\\nempty, and that I wanted to have it filled.  They called immediately to\\nsome of their friends, and there came two women, and brought a great\\nvessel made of earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun, this they set\\ndown to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled\\nthem all three.  The women were as naked as the men.\\nI was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and\\nleaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,\\nwithout offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a\\ngreat length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues\\nbefore me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing to make\\nthis point.  At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the\\nland, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I concluded,\\nas it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verde, and those\\nthe islands called, from thence, Cape de Verde Islands.  However, they\\nwere at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to\\ndo; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach\\none or other.\\nIn this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and sat\\ndown, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,\\n“Master, master, a ship with a sail!” and the foolish boy was frighted\\nout of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master’s ships\\nsent to pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach.  I\\njumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that\\nit was a Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of\\nGuinea, for negroes.  But, when I observed the course she steered, I was\\nsoon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not design to come\\nany nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I\\ncould, resolving to speak with them if possible.\\nWith all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in\\ntheir way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal\\nto them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair,\\nthey, it seems, saw by the help of their glasses that it was some\\nEuropean boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship that was\\nlost; so they shortened sail to let me come up.  I was encouraged with\\nthis, and as I had my patron’s ancient on board, I made a waft of it to\\nthem, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for\\nthey told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun.  Upon\\nthese signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in\\nabout three hours; time I came up with them.\\nThey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,\\nbut I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch sailor, who was on\\nboard, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an\\nEnglishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at\\nSallee; they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and\\nall my goods.\\nIt was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was\\nthus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost\\nhopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to\\nthe captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he\\ngenerously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had\\nshould be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils.  “For,” says\\nhe, “I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be\\nsaved myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in\\nthe same condition.  Besides,” said he, “when I carry you to the Brazils,\\nso great a way from your own country, if I should take from you what you\\nhave, you will be starved there, and then I only take away that life I\\nhave given.  No, no,” says he: “Seignior Inglese” (Mr. Englishman), “I\\nwill carry you thither in charity, and those things will help to buy your\\nsubsistence there, and your passage home again.”\\nAs he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the performance\\nto a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything\\nthat I had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me\\nback an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my three\\nearthen jars.\\nAs to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he\\nwould buy it of me for his ship’s use; and asked me what I would have for\\nit?  I told him he had been so generous to me in everything that I could\\nnot offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him:\\nupon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty\\npieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any one\\noffered to give more, he would make it up.  He offered me also sixty\\npieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that\\nI was unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell\\nthe poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my\\nown.  However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and\\noffered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set\\nhim free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon this, and Xury saying\\nhe was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.\\nWe had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de\\nTodos los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days after.\\nAnd now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all\\nconditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.\\nThe generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough remember:\\nhe would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the\\nleopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat,\\nand caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me;\\nand what I was willing to sell he bought of me, such as the case of\\nbottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax—for I had\\nmade candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty\\npieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore in\\nthe Brazils.\\nI had not been long here before I was recommended to the house of a good\\nhonest man like himself, who had an _ingenio_, as they call it (that is,\\na plantation and a sugar-house).  I lived with him some time, and\\nacquainted myself by that means with the manner of planting and making of\\nsugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich\\nsuddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would\\nturn planter among them: resolving in the meantime to find out some way\\nto get my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.  To this\\npurpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalisation, I purchased as much\\nland that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my\\nplantation and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the stock\\nwhich I proposed to myself to receive from England.\\nI had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English parents,\\nwhose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was.  I call\\nhim my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on\\nvery sociably together.  My stock was but low, as well as his; and we\\nrather planted for food than anything else, for about two years.\\nHowever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so\\nthat the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large\\npiece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come.  But we\\nboth wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in\\nparting with my boy Xury.\\nBut, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder.\\nI hail no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment quite remote\\nto my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for\\nwhich I forsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good advice.\\nNay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low\\nlife, which my father advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to\\ngo on with, I might as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued\\nmyself in the world as I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I\\ncould have done this as well in England, among my friends, as have gone\\nfive thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a\\nwilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the\\nworld that had the least knowledge of me.\\nIn this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.\\nI had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work\\nto be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived\\njust like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody\\nthere but himself.  But how just has it been—and how should all men\\nreflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others that\\nare worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced\\nof their former felicity by their experience—I say, how just has it been,\\nthat the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island of mere\\ndesolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with\\nthe life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had in all\\nprobability been exceeding prosperous and rich.\\nI was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the\\nplantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up\\nat sea, went back—for the ship remained there, in providing his lading\\nand preparing for his voyage, nearly three months—when telling him what\\nlittle stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and\\nsincere advice:—“Seignior Inglese,” says he (for so he always called me),\\n“if you will give me letters, and a procuration in form to me, with\\norders to the person who has your money in London to send your effects to\\nLisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are\\nproper for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, God\\nwilling, at my return; but, since human affairs are all subject to\\nchanges and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred\\npounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard\\nbe run for the first; so that, if it come safe, you may order the rest\\nthe same way, and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have\\nrecourse to for your supply.”\\nThis was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not\\nbut be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly\\nprepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and a\\nprocuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.\\nI wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of all my\\nadventures—my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese\\ncaptain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was\\nnow in, with all other necessary directions for my supply; and when this\\nhonest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English\\nmerchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of\\nmy story to a merchant in London, who represented it effectually to her;\\nwhereupon she not only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket\\nsent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and\\ncharity to me.\\nThe merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,\\nsuch as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,\\nand he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without\\nmy direction (for I was too young in my business to think of them), he\\nhad taken care to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and utensils\\nnecessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.\\nWhen this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised\\nwith the joy of it; and my stood steward, the captain, had laid out the\\nfive pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to\\npurchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years’ service,\\nand would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which\\nI would have him accept, being of my own produce.\\nNeither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such as\\ncloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in\\nthe country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so\\nthat I might say I had more than four times the value of my first cargo,\\nand was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour—I mean in the advancement\\nof my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave,\\nand an European servant also—I mean another besides that which the\\ncaptain brought me from Lisbon.\\nBut as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our\\ngreatest adversity, so it was with me.  I went on the next year with\\ngreat success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on\\nmy own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my\\nneighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight,\\nwere well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon:\\nand now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be full of\\nprojects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the\\nruin of the best heads in business.  Had I continued in the station I was\\nnow in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for\\nwhich my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of\\nwhich he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full\\nof; but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent\\nof all my own miseries; and particularly, to increase my fault, and\\ndouble the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should\\nhave leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent\\nobstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and\\npursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of\\ndoing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and\\nthose measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to present\\nme with, and to make my duty.\\nAs I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could\\nnot be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being\\na rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and\\nimmoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted;\\nand thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery\\nthat ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a\\nstate of health in the world.\\nTo come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of my\\nstory.  You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the\\nBrazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my\\nplantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted\\nacquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among\\nthe merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my\\ndiscourses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two\\nvoyages to the coast of Guinea: the manner of trading with the negroes\\nthere, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles—such as\\nbeads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like—not\\nonly gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, &c., but negroes, for\\nthe service of the Brazils, in great numbers.\\nThey listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,\\nbut especially to that part which related to the buying of negroes, which\\nwas a trade at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as far as\\nit was, had been carried on by assientos, or permission of the kings of\\nSpain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock: so that few\\nnegroes were bought, and these excessively dear.\\nIt happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my\\nacquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them\\ncame to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon\\nwhat I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make\\na secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy, they told me\\nthat they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all\\nplantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as\\nservants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because\\nthey could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they\\ndesired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately,\\nand divide them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question\\nwas whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the\\ntrading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should\\nhave my equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the\\nstock.\\nThis was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any\\none that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look\\nafter, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and\\nwith a good stock upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and\\nestablished, and had nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for three\\nor four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from\\nEngland; and who in that time, and with that little addition, could\\nscarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling,\\nand that increasing too—for me to think of such a voyage was the most\\npreposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty\\nof.\\nBut I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the\\noffer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father’s\\ngood counsel was lost upon me.  In a word, I told them I would go with\\nall my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my\\nabsence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I\\nmiscarried.  This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or\\ncovenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation\\nand effects in case of my death, making the captain of the ship that had\\nsaved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose\\nof my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the produce being\\nto himself, and the other to be shipped to England.\\nIn short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and to keep\\nup my plantation.  Had I used half as much prudence to have looked into\\nmy own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done\\nand not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous\\nan undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving\\ncircumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common\\nhazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular\\nmisfortunes to myself.\\nBut I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather\\nthan my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the\\ncargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my partners in\\nthe voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st September 1659,\\nbeing the same day eight years that I went from my father and mother at\\nHull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my\\nown interests.\\nOur ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns\\nand fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself.  We had on\\nboard no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our\\ntrade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other\\ntrifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets,\\nand the like.\\nThe same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the northward\\nupon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast\\nwhen we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it\\nseems, was the manner of course in those days.  We had very good weather,\\nonly excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came to the\\nheight of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we\\nlost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando\\nde Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the\\neast.  In this course we passed the line in about twelve days’ time, and\\nwere, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes\\nnorthern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite\\nout of our knowledge.  It began from the south-east, came about to the\\nnorth-west, and then settled in the north-east; from whence it blew in\\nsuch a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing\\nbut drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither fate and\\nthe fury of the winds directed; and, during these twelve days, I need not\\nsay that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in\\nthe ship expect to save their lives.\\nIn this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men\\ndie of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed overboard.  About\\nthe twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an\\nobservation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven\\ndegrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude\\ndifference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was upon the\\ncoast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon,\\ntoward that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River; and\\nbegan to consult with me what course he should take, for the ship was\\nleaky, and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the\\ncoast of Brazil.\\nI was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the\\nsea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited\\ncountry for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the\\nCaribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes;\\nwhich, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of\\nMexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days’\\nsail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of\\nAfrica without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves.\\nWith this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W., in\\norder to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief.\\nBut our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of\\ntwelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which\\ncarried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out\\nof the way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as\\nto the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than\\never returning to our own country.\\nIn this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early\\nin the morning cried out, “Land!” and we had no sooner run out of the\\ncabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,\\nthan the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment her motion being so\\nstopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we\\nshould all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into\\nour close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the\\nsea.\\nIt is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to\\ndescribe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances.  We\\nknew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were\\ndriven—whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited.\\nAs the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at\\nfirst, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes\\nwithout breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle,\\nshould turn immediately about.  In a word, we sat looking upon one\\nanother, and expecting death every moment, and every man, accordingly,\\npreparing for another world; for there was little or nothing more for us\\nto do in this.  That which was our present comfort, and all the comfort\\nwe had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not break\\nyet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.\\nNow, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship\\nhaving thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect\\nher getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing\\nto do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.  We had a\\nboat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by\\ndashing against the ship’s rudder, and in the next place she broke away,\\nand either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope from her.\\nWe had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a\\ndoubtful thing.  However, there was no time to debate, for we fancied\\nthat the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us she\\nwas actually broken already.\\nIn this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with\\nthe help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship’s side; and\\ngetting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in\\nnumber, to God’s mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated\\nconsiderably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore, and might\\nbe well called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.\\nAnd now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that the\\nsea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be\\ninevitably drowned.  As to making sail, we had none, nor if we had could\\nwe have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,\\nthough with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew\\nthat when the boat came near the shore she would be dashed in a thousand\\npieces by the breach of the sea.  However, we committed our souls to God\\nin the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we\\nhastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could\\ntowards land.\\nWhat the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew\\nnot.  The only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of\\nexpectation was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some\\nriver, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under\\nthe lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.  But there was\\nnothing like this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore,\\nthe land looked more frightful than the sea.\\nAfter we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a half, as we\\nreckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and\\nplainly bade us expect the _coup de grâce_.  It took us with such a fury,\\nthat it overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from the boat\\nas from one another, gave us no time to say, “O God!” for we were all\\nswallowed up in a moment.\\nNothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sank\\ninto the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver\\nmyself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven\\nme, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having\\nspent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half\\ndead with the water I took in.  I had so much presence of mind, as well\\nas breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I\\ngot upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as\\nI could before another wave should return and take me up again; but I\\nsoon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me\\nas high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means\\nor strength to contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise\\nmyself upon the water if I could; and so, by swimming, to preserve my\\nbreathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my greatest\\nconcern now being that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards\\nthe shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it\\ngave back towards the sea.\\nThe wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet\\ndeep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force\\nand swiftness towards the shore—a very great way; but I held my breath,\\nand assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.  I was ready\\nto burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to\\nmy immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the\\nsurface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I\\ncould keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new\\ncourage.  I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long\\nbut I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to\\nreturn, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground\\nagain with my feet.  I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and\\ntill the waters went from me, and then took to my heels and ran with what\\nstrength I had further towards the shore.  But neither would this deliver\\nme from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again; and\\ntwice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forward as before,\\nthe shore being very flat.\\nThe last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for the sea\\nhaving hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,\\nagainst a piece of rock, and that with such force, that it left me\\nsenseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow\\ntaking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my\\nbody; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled\\nin the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,\\nand seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold\\nfast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till\\nthe wave went back.  Now, as the waves were not so high as at first,\\nbeing nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched\\nanother run, which brought me so near the shore that the next wave,\\nthough it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away;\\nand the next run I took, I got to the mainland, where, to my great\\ncomfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat me down upon the\\ngrass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water.\\nI was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God\\nthat my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before\\nscarce any room to hope.  I believe it is impossible to express, to the\\nlife, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so\\nsaved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at\\nthe custom, when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied\\nup, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him—I\\nsay, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood\\nthat very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the\\nanimal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him.\\n    “For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.”\\nI walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I\\nmay say, wrapped up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a\\nthousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon\\nall my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul\\nsaved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any\\nsign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that\\nwere not fellows.\\nI cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the\\nsea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and\\nconsidered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?\\nAfter I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I\\nbegan to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was\\nnext to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,\\nI had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,\\nnor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any\\nprospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by\\nwild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I\\nhad no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or\\nto defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me\\nfor theirs.  In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a\\ntobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box.  This was all my provisions;\\nand this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I\\nran about like a madman.  Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy\\nheart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts\\nin that country, as at night they always come abroad for their prey.\\nAll the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up\\ninto a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and\\nwhere I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I\\nshould die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life.  I walked about a\\nfurlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,\\nwhich I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco\\ninto my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into\\nit, endeavoured to place myself so that if I should sleep I might not\\nfall.  And having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence,\\nI took up my lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast\\nasleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my\\ncondition, and found myself more refreshed with it than, I think, I ever\\nwas on such an occasion.\\nCHAPTER IV—FIRST WEEKS ON THE ISLAND\\nWhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,\\nso that the sea did not rage and swell as before.  But that which\\nsurprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the\\nsand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost\\nas far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so\\nbruised by the wave dashing me against it.  This being within about a\\nmile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright\\nstill, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some\\nnecessary things for my use.\\nWhen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again,\\nand the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and the\\nsea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand.\\nI walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a\\nneck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a\\nmile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon\\ngetting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present\\nsubsistence.\\nA little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far\\nout that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.  And here I\\nfound a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had\\nkept on board we had been all safe—that is to say, we had all got safe on\\nshore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute\\nof all comfort and company as I now was.  This forced tears to my eyes\\nagain; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible,\\nto get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes—for the weather was hot to\\nextremity—and took the water.  But when I came to the ship my difficulty\\nwas still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground,\\nand high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold\\nof.  I swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of\\nrope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the\\nfore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and\\nby the help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship.  Here\\nI found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her\\nhold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather\\nearth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,\\nalmost to the water.  By this means all her quarter was free, and all\\nthat was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to\\nsearch, and to see what was spoiled and what was free.  And, first, I\\nfound that all the ship’s provisions were dry and untouched by the water,\\nand being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread room and filled\\nmy pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I\\nhad no time to lose.  I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which\\nI took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me\\nfor what was before me.  Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish\\nmyself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.\\nIt was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this\\nextremity roused my application.  We had several spare yards, and two or\\nthree large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I\\nresolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them\\noverboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a\\nrope, that they might not drive away.  When this was done I went down the\\nship’s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both\\nends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three\\nshort pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it\\nvery well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces\\nbeing too light.  So I went to work, and with a carpenter’s saw I cut a\\nspare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great\\ndeal of labour and pains.  But the hope of furnishing myself with\\nnecessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to\\nhave done upon another occasion.\\nMy raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.  My next\\ncare was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it\\nfrom the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this.  I first\\nlaid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having\\nconsidered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen’s chests,\\nwhich I had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft;\\nthe first of these I filled with provisions—viz. bread, rice, three Dutch\\ncheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh (which we lived much upon),\\nand a little remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some\\nfowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed.  There\\nhad been some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment,\\nI found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all.  As for\\nliquors, I found several, cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in\\nwhich were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of\\nrack.  These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into\\nthe chest, nor any room for them.  While I was doing this, I found the\\ntide begin to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see\\nmy coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the\\nsand, swim away.  As for my breeches, which were only linen, and\\nopen-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings.  However, this set\\nme on rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more\\nthan I wanted for present use, for I had others things which my eye was\\nmore upon—as, first, tools to work with on shore.  And it was after long\\nsearching that I found out the carpenter’s chest, which was, indeed, a\\nvery useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a shipload of gold\\nwould have been at that time.  I got it down to my raft, whole as it was,\\nwithout losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it\\ncontained.\\nMy next care was for some ammunition and arms.  There were two very good\\nfowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols.  These I secured\\nfirst, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty\\nswords.  I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew\\nnot where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them,\\ntwo of them dry and good, the third had taken water.  Those two I got to\\nmy raft with the arms.  And now I thought myself pretty well freighted,\\nand began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither\\nsail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset\\nall my navigation.\\nI had three encouragements—1st, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide\\nrising, and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was\\nblew me towards the land.  And thus, having found two or three broken\\noars belonging to the boat—and, besides the tools which were in the\\nchest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer; with this cargo I put to\\nsea.  For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very well, only that I found\\nit drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before; by\\nwhich I perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and\\nconsequently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might\\nmake use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.\\nAs I imagined, so it was.  There appeared before me a little opening of\\nthe land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I\\nguided my raft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.\\nBut here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had,\\nI think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the\\ncoast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being\\naground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had\\nslipped off towards the end that was afloat, and to fallen into the\\nwater.  I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep\\nthem in their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my\\nstrength; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up\\nthe chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half-an-hour,\\nin which time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a\\nlevel; and a little after, the water still-rising, my raft floated again,\\nand I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then\\ndriving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little\\nriver, with land on both sides, and a strong current of tide running up.\\nI looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not\\nwilling to be driven too high up the river: hoping in time to see some\\nships at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as\\nI could.\\nAt length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which\\nwith great pain and difficulty I guided my raft, and at last got so near\\nthat, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in.  But\\nhere I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that\\nshore lying pretty steep—that is to say sloping—there was no place to\\nland, but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so\\nhigh, and the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my\\ncargo again.  All that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the\\nhighest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of\\nit fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the\\nwater would flow over; and so it did.  As soon as I found water\\nenough—for my raft drew about a foot of water—I thrust her upon that flat\\npiece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my two\\nbroken oars into the ground, one on one side near one end, and one on the\\nother side near the other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away,\\nand left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.\\nMy next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my\\nhabitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might\\nhappen.  Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent or on an\\nisland; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of wild\\nbeasts or not.  There was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up\\nvery steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, which\\nlay as in a ridge from it northward.  I took out one of the\\nfowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus\\narmed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, after\\nI had with great labour and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate, to\\nmy great affliction—viz. that I was in an island environed every way with\\nthe sea: no land to be seen except some rocks, which lay a great way off;\\nand two small islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues to\\nthe west.\\nI found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good\\nreason to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I\\nsaw none.  Yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds;\\nneither when I killed them could I tell what was fit for food, and what\\nnot.  At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon\\na tree on the side of a great wood.  I believe it was the first gun that\\nhad been fired there since the creation of the world.  I had no sooner\\nfired, than from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number\\nof fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming and crying, and\\nevery one according to his usual note, but not one of them of any kind\\nthat I knew.  As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of\\nhawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws\\nmore than common.  Its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.\\nContented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work\\nto bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day.  What\\nto do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I\\nwas afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast\\nmight devour me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need\\nfor those fears.\\nHowever, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chest and\\nboards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that\\nnight’s lodging.  As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself,\\nexcept that I had seen two or three creatures like hares run out of the\\nwood where I shot the fowl.\\nI now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of\\nthe ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the\\nrigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land; and I\\nresolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible.  And as\\nI knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in\\npieces, I resolved to set all other things apart till I had got\\neverything out of the ship that I could get.  Then I called a\\ncouncil—that is to say in my thoughts—whether I should take back the\\nraft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as before,\\nwhen the tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went\\nfrom my hut, having nothing on but my chequered shirt, a pair of linen\\ndrawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.\\nI got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and,\\nhaving had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor\\nloaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to\\nme; as first, in the carpenters stores I found two or three bags full of\\nnails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and,\\nabove all, that most useful thing called a grindstone.  All these I\\nsecured, together with several things belonging to the gunner,\\nparticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets,\\nseven muskets, another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder\\nmore; a large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-lead; but\\nthis last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship’s\\nside.\\nBesides these things, I took all the men’s clothes that I could find, and\\na spare fore-topsail, a hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded\\nmy second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great\\ncomfort.\\nI was under some apprehension, during my absence from the land, that at\\nleast my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back I\\nfound no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat\\nupon one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little\\ndistance, and then stood still.  She sat very composed and unconcerned,\\nand looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with\\nme.  I presented my gun at her, but, as she did not understand it, she\\nwas perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon\\nwhich I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way, I was not very\\nfree of it, for my store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I\\nsay, and she went to it, smelled at it, and ate it, and looked (as if\\npleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more: so she\\nmarched off.\\nHaving got my second cargo on shore—though I was fain to open the barrels\\nof powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being\\nlarge casks—I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail and\\nsome poles which I cut for that purpose: and into this tent I brought\\neverything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled\\nall the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify\\nit from any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.\\nWhen I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards\\nwithin, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading one of\\nthe beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my\\ngun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very\\nquietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before I\\nhad slept little, and had laboured very hard all day to fetch all those\\nthings from the ship, and to get them on shore.\\nI had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I\\nbelieve, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship\\nsat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of\\nher that I could; so every day at low water I went on board, and brought\\naway something or other; but particularly the third time I went I brought\\naway as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and\\nrope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend\\nthe sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.  In a word, I\\nbrought away all the sails, first and last; only that I was fain to cut\\nthem in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could, for they were no\\nmore useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.\\nBut that which comforted me more still, was, that last of all, after I\\nhad made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing\\nmore to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with—I say, after\\nall this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum,\\nor spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was\\nsurprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions,\\nexcept what was spoiled by the water.  I soon emptied the hogshead of the\\nbread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which\\nI cut out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also.\\nThe next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship of\\nwhat was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables.  Cutting\\nthe great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a\\nhawser on shore, with all the ironwork I could get; and having cut down\\nthe spritsail-yard, and the mizzen-yard, and everything I could, to make\\na large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and came away.  But\\nmy good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy, and so\\noverladen, that, after I had entered the little cove where I had landed\\nthe rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the\\nother, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water.  As for\\nmyself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my\\ncargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I\\nexpected would have been of great use to me; however, when the tide was\\nout, I got most of the pieces of the cable ashore, and some of the iron,\\nthough with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water,\\na work which fatigued me very much.  After this, I went every day on\\nboard, and brought away what I could get.\\nI had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on board\\nthe ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands\\ncould well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the\\ncalm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by\\npiece.  But preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind\\nbegan to rise: however, at low water I went on board, and though I\\nthought I had rummaged the cabin so effectually that nothing more could\\nbe found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I\\nfound two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten\\nor a dozen of good knives and forks: in another I found about thirty-six\\npounds value in money—some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of\\neight, some gold, and some silver.\\nI smiled to myself at the sight of this money: “O drug!” said I, aloud,\\n“what art thou good for?  Thou art not worth to me—no, not the taking off\\nthe ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap; I have no manner\\nof use for thee—e’en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom as a\\ncreature whose life is not worth saying.”  However, upon second thoughts\\nI took it away; and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to\\nthink of making another raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the\\nsky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it\\nblew a fresh gale from the shore.  It presently occurred to me that it\\nwas in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind offshore; and that it\\nwas my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I\\nmight not be able to reach the shore at all.  Accordingly, I let myself\\ndown into the water, and swam across the channel, which lay between the\\nship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the\\nweight of the things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the\\nwater; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water\\nit blew a storm.\\nBut I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth\\nabout me, very secure.  It blew very hard all night, and in the morning,\\nwhen I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen!  I was a little\\nsurprised, but recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection that I\\nhad lost no time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of her\\nthat could be useful to me; and that, indeed, there was little left in\\nher that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.\\nI now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her,\\nexcept what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed, divers\\npieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use to me.\\nMy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against either\\nsavages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island;\\nand I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of\\ndwelling to make—whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent\\nupon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both; the manner and\\ndescription of which, it may not be improper to give an account of.\\nI soon found the place I was in was not fit for my settlement, because it\\nwas upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not\\nbe wholesome, and more particularly because there was no fresh water near\\nit; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more convenient spot of\\nground.\\nI consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be proper\\nfor me: 1st, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned; 2ndly, shelter\\nfrom the heat of the sun; 3rdly, security from ravenous creatures,\\nwhether man or beast; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship\\nin sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I\\nwas not willing to banish all my expectation yet.\\nIn search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side\\nof a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a\\nhouse-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the top.  On the\\none side of the rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like\\nthe entrance or door of a cave but there was not really any cave or way\\ninto the rock at all.\\nOn the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to\\npitch my tent.  This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and about\\ntwice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the end of\\nit, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by the\\nseaside.  It was on the N.N.W. side of the hill; so that it was sheltered\\nfrom the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or\\nthereabouts, which, in those countries, is near the setting.\\nBefore I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place,\\nwhich took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and\\ntwenty yards in its diameter from its beginning and ending.\\nIn this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them\\ninto the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end\\nbeing out of the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on the\\ntop.  The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.\\nThen I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid\\nthem in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows\\nof stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning\\nagainst them, about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and\\nthis fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it or\\nover it.  This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cut\\nthe piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into the\\nearth.\\nThe entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a short\\nladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over\\nafter me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought,\\nfrom all the world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which\\notherwise I could not have done; though, as it appeared afterwards, there\\nwas no need of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehended\\ndanger from.\\nInto this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my\\nriches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the\\naccount above; and I made a large tent, which to preserve me from the\\nrains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made\\ndouble—one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it; and covered\\nthe uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.\\nAnd now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on\\nshore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belonged\\nto the mate of the ship.\\nInto this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would\\nspoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the\\nentrance, which till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as\\nI said, by a short ladder.\\nWhen I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing\\nall the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, I laid them\\nup within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the\\nground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just\\nbehind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house.\\nIt cost me much labour and many days before all these things were brought\\nto perfection; and therefore I must go back to some other things which\\ntook up some of my thoughts.  At the same time it happened, after I had\\nlaid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a\\nstorm of rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of\\nlightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is\\nnaturally the effect of it.  I was not so much surprised with the\\nlightning as I was with the thought which darted into my mind as swift as\\nthe lightning itself—Oh, my powder!  My very heart sank within me when I\\nthought that, at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed; on which,\\nnot my defence only, but the providing my food, as I thought, entirely\\ndepended.  I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, had\\nthe powder took fire, I should never have known who had hurt me.\\nSuch impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over I\\nlaid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself\\nto make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little\\nand a little in a parcel, in the hope that, whatever might come, it might\\nnot all take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should not be\\npossible to make one part fire another.  I finished this work in about a\\nfortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and\\nforty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels.  As\\nto the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from\\nthat; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my\\nkitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that\\nno wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.\\nIn the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least\\nevery day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I could kill\\nanything fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with\\nwhat the island produced.  The first time I went out, I presently\\ndiscovered that there were goats in the island, which was a great\\nsatisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune to\\nme—viz. that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it\\nwas the most difficult thing in the world to come at them; but I was not\\ndiscouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as\\nit soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid\\nwait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw me in the valleys,\\nthough they were upon the rocks, they would run away, as in a terrible\\nfright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the\\nrocks, they took no notice of me; from whence I concluded that, by the\\nposition of their optics, their sight was so directed downward that they\\ndid not readily see objects that were above them; so afterwards I took\\nthis method—I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then\\nhad frequently a fair mark.\\nThe first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which\\nhad a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me\\nheartily; for when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her,\\ntill I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old\\none with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my\\nenclosure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,\\nand carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it\\nwould not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself.  These two\\nsupplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my\\nprovisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could.\\nHaving now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to\\nprovide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn: and what I did for\\nthat, and also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I\\nshall give a full account of in its place; but I must now give some\\nlittle account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it may\\nwell be supposed, were not a few.\\nI had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast away upon\\nthat island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite\\nout of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz. some\\nhundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind,\\nI had great reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in\\nthis desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.\\nThe tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these\\nreflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence\\nshould thus completely ruin His creatures, and render them so absolutely\\nmiserable; so without help, abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it\\ncould hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.\\nBut something always returned swift upon me to check these thoughts, and\\nto reprove me; and particularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand\\nby the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my present\\ncondition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other way,\\nthus: “Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but, pray\\nremember, where are the rest of you?  Did not you come, eleven of you in\\nthe boat?  Where are the ten?  Why were they not saved, and you lost?\\nWhy were you singled out?  Is it better to be here or there?”  And then I\\npointed to the sea.  All evils are to be considered with the good that is\\nin them, and with what worse attends them.\\nThen it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my\\nsubsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened\\n(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the\\nplace where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore that I\\nhad time to get all these things out of her; what would have been my\\ncase, if I had been forced to have lived in the condition in which I at\\nfirst came on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to\\nsupply and procure them?  “Particularly,” said I, aloud (though to\\nmyself), “what should I have done without a gun, without ammunition,\\nwithout any tools to make anything, or to work with, without clothes,\\nbedding, a tent, or any manner of covering?” and that now I had all these\\nto sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a\\nmanner as to live without my gun, when my ammunition was spent: so that I\\nhad a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived;\\nfor I considered from the beginning how I would provide for the accidents\\nthat might happen, and for the time that was to come, even not only after\\nmy ammunition should be spent, but even after my health and strength\\nshould decay.\\nI confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being\\ndestroyed at one blast—I mean my powder being blown up by lightning; and\\nthis made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened and\\nthundered, as I observed just now.\\nAnd now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of\\nsilent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I\\nshall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its order.  It was\\nby my account the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above said, I\\nfirst set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun, being to us in its\\nautumnal equinox, was almost over my head; for I reckoned myself, by\\nobservation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes\\nnorth of the line.\\nAfter I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my thoughts\\nthat I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and\\nink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent this, I cut\\nwith my knife upon a large post, in capital letters—and making it into a\\ngreat cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed—“I came on\\nshore here on the 30th September 1659.”\\nUpon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with my knife,\\nand every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first\\nday of the month as long again as that long one; and thus I kept my\\ncalendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.\\nIn the next place, we are to observe that among the many things which I\\nbrought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above\\nmentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at\\nall less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as, in\\nparticular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain’s,\\nmate’s, gunner’s and carpenter’s keeping; three or four compasses, some\\nmathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of\\nnavigation, all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or\\nno; also, I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo\\nfrom England, and which I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese\\nbooks also; and among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and several\\nother books, all which I carefully secured.  And I must not forget that\\nwe had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may\\nhave occasion to say something in its place; for I carried both the cats\\nwith me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and\\nswam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,\\nand was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted nothing that he could\\nfetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted to\\nhave him talk to me, but that would not do.  As I observed before, I\\nfound pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I\\nshall show that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after\\nthat was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink by any means that\\nI could devise.\\nAnd this put me in mind that I wanted many things notwithstanding all\\nthat I had amassed together; and of these, ink was one; as also a spade,\\npickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and\\nthread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much\\ndifficulty.\\nThis want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was near a\\nwhole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded\\nmy habitation.  The piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well\\nlift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more,\\nby far, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting\\nand bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into\\nthe ground; for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but\\nat last bethought myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though\\nI found it, made driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious\\nwork.\\nBut what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything\\nI had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in? nor had I any other\\nemployment, if that had been over, at least that I could foresee, except\\nthe ranging the island to seek for food, which I did, more or less, every\\nday.\\nI now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I\\nwas reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so\\nmuch to leave them to any that were to come after me—for I was likely to\\nhave but few heirs—as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring over them,\\nand afflicting my mind; and as my reason began now to master my\\ndespondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the\\ngood against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case\\nfrom worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the\\ncomforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus:—\\n             _Evil_.                             _Good_.\\nI am cast upon a horrible,          But I am alive; and not drowned,\\ndesolate island, void of all hope   as all my ship’s company were.\\nof recovery.\\nI am singled out and separated,     But I am singled out, too, from\\nas it were, from all the world,     all the ship’s crew, to be spared\\nto be miserable.                    from death; and He that\\n                                    miraculously saved me from death\\n                                    can deliver me from this\\n                                    condition.\\nI am divided from mankind—a         But I am not starved, and\\nsolitaire; one banished from        perishing on a barren place,\\nhuman society.                      affording no sustenance.\\nI have no clothes to cover me.      But I am in a hot climate, where,\\n                                    if I had clothes, I could hardly\\n                                    wear them.\\nI am without any defence, or        But I am cast on an island where\\nmeans to resist any violence of     I see no wild beasts to hurt me,\\nman or beast.                       as I saw on the coast of Africa;\\n                                    and what if I had been\\n                                    shipwrecked there?\\nI have no soul to speak to or       But God wonderfully sent the ship\\nrelieve me.                         in near enough to the shore, that\\n                                    I have got out as many necessary\\n                                    things as will either supply my\\n                                    wants or enable me to supply\\n                                    myself, even as long as I live.\\nUpon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce any\\ncondition in the world so miserable but there was something negative or\\nsomething positive to be thankful for in it; and let this stand as a\\ndirection from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions in\\nthis world: that we may always find in it something to comfort ourselves\\nfrom, and to set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit side\\nof the account.\\nHaving now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given\\nover looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship—I say, giving over\\nthese things, I began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to\\nmake things as easy to me as I could.\\nI have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\\nof a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables: but I might\\nnow rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of\\nturfs, about two feet thick on the outside; and after some time (I think\\nit was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock,\\nand thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I\\ncould get, to keep out the rain; which I found at some times of the year\\nvery violent.\\nI have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\\ninto the cave which I had made behind me.  But I must observe, too, that\\nat first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no\\norder, so they took up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so I\\nset myself to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth; for it\\nwas a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on\\nit: and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked\\nsideways, to the right hand, into the rock; and then, turning to the\\nright again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the\\noutside of my pale or fortification.  This gave me not only egress and\\nregress, as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave\\nme room to store my goods.\\nAnd now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I found\\nI most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I was\\nnot able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not write\\nor eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure without a table: so I\\nwent to work.  And here I must needs observe, that as reason is the\\nsubstance and origin of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring\\neverything by reason, and by making the most rational judgment of things,\\nevery man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art.  I had never\\nhandled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labour, application, and\\ncontrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made\\nit, especially if I had had tools.  However, I made abundance of things,\\neven without tools; and some with no more tools than an adze and a\\nhatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and that with\\ninfinite labour.  For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way\\nbut to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on\\neither side with my axe, till I brought it to be thin as a plank, and\\nthen dub it smooth with my adze.  It is true, by this method I could make\\nbut one board out of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but\\npatience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour\\nwhich it took me up to make a plank or board: but my time or labour was\\nlittle worth, and so it was as well employed one way as another.\\nHowever, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the first\\nplace; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on\\nmy raft from the ship.  But when I had wrought out some boards as above,\\nI made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over\\nanother all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails and\\nironwork on; and, in a word, to separate everything at large into their\\nplaces, that I might come easily at them.  I knocked pieces into the wall\\nof the rock to hang my guns and all things that would hang up; so that,\\nhad my cave been to be seen, it looked like a general magazine of all\\nnecessary things; and had everything so ready at my hand, that it was a\\ngreat pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and especially to\\nfind my stock of all necessaries so great.\\nAnd now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day’s employment;\\nfor, indeed, at first I was in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to\\nlabour, but in too much discomposure of mind; and my journal would have\\nbeen full of many dull things; for example, I must have said thus:\\n“30_th_.—After I had got to shore, and escaped drowning, instead of being\\nthankful to God for my deliverance, having first vomited, with the great\\nquantity of salt water which had got into my stomach, and recovering\\nmyself a little, I ran about the shore wringing my hands and beating my\\nhead and face, exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, ‘I was undone,\\nundone!’ till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground to\\nrepose, but durst not sleep for fear of being devoured.”\\nSome days after this, and after I had been on board the ship, and got all\\nthat I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of\\na little mountain and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship; then\\nfancy at a vast distance I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of\\nit, and then after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it\\nquite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by\\nmy folly.\\nBut having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled\\nmy household staff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all\\nas handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal; of which I\\nshall here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these\\nparticulars over again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I\\nwas forced to leave it off.\\nCHAPTER V—BUILDS A HOUSE—THE JOURNAL\\nSeptember 30, 1659.—I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked\\nduring a dreadful storm in the offing, came on shore on this dismal,\\nunfortunate island, which I called “The Island of Despair”; all the rest\\nof the ship’s company being drowned, and myself almost dead.\\nAll the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal\\ncircumstances I was brought to—viz. I had neither food, house, clothes,\\nweapon, nor place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw nothing\\nbut death before me—either that I should be devoured by wild beasts,\\nmurdered by savages, or starved to death for want of food.  At the\\napproach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but\\nslept soundly, though it rained all night.\\n_October_ 1.—In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had\\nfloated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer the\\nisland; which, as it was some comfort, on one hand—for, seeing her set\\nupright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might\\nget on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my\\nrelief—so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my\\ncomrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on board, might have\\nsaved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been all drowned\\nas they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have\\nbuilt us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have carried us to some\\nother part of the world.  I spent great part of this day in perplexing\\nmyself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went\\nupon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board.  This day also\\nit continued raining, though with no wind at all.\\n_From the 1st of October to the 24th_.—All these days entirely spent in\\nmany several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought\\non shore every tide of flood upon rafts.  Much rain also in the days,\\nthough with some intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was the\\nrainy season.\\n_Oct._ 20.—I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but,\\nbeing in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered\\nmany of them when the tide was out.\\n_Oct._ 25.—It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind;\\nduring which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little\\nharder than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,\\nand that only at low water.  I spent this day in covering and securing\\nthe goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.\\n_Oct._ 26.—I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place\\nto fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack\\nin the night, either from wild beasts or men.  Towards night, I fixed\\nupon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my\\nencampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or\\nfortification, made of double piles, lined within with cables, and\\nwithout with turf.\\nFrom the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in carrying all my goods to\\nmy new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceedingly\\nhard.\\nThe 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to seek\\nfor some food, and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and\\nher kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it\\nwould not feed.\\n_November_ 1.—I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first\\nnight; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my\\nhammock upon.\\n_Nov._ 2.—I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber\\nwhich made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little\\nwithin the place I had marked out for my fortification.\\n_Nov._ 3.—I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, which\\nwere very good food.  In the afternoon went to work to make me a table.\\n_Nov_. 4.—This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out\\nwith my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion—viz. every morning I\\nwalked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then\\nemployed myself to work till about eleven o’clock; then eat what I had to\\nlive on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being\\nexcessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again.  The working\\npart of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table,\\nfor I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me\\na complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any\\none else.\\n_Nov._ 5.—This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a wild\\ncat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature\\nthat I killed I took of the skins and preserved them.  Coming back by the\\nsea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but\\nwas surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals, which,\\nwhile I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea,\\nand escaped me for that time.\\n_Nov._ 6.—After my morning walk I went to work with my table again, and\\nfinished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I learned to\\nmend it.\\n_Nov._ 7.—Now it began to be settled fair weather.  The 7th, 8th, 9th,\\n10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to\\nmake me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but\\nnever to please me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several\\ntimes.\\n_Note_.—I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for\\nthem on my post, I forgot which was which.\\n_Nov._ 13.—This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled\\nthe earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,\\nwhich frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder.  As soon as it was\\nover, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many little\\nparcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.\\n_Nov._ 14, 15, 16.—These three days I spent in making little square\\nchests, or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most,\\nof powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure\\nand remote from one another as possible.  On one of these three days I\\nkilled a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.\\n_Nov._ 17.—This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to make\\nroom for my further conveniency.\\n_Note_.—Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work—viz. a pickaxe, a\\nshovel, and a wheelbarrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and\\nbegan to consider how to supply that want, and make me some tools.  As\\nfor the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough,\\nthough heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so\\nabsolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually\\nwithout it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.\\n_Nov._ 18.—The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that\\nwood, or like it, which in the Brazils they call the iron-tree, for its\\nexceeding hardness.  Of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my\\naxe, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for\\nit was exceeding heavy.  The excessive hardness of the wood, and my\\nhaving no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for I worked\\nit effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade;\\nthe handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the board part\\nhaving no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long;\\nhowever, it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put\\nit to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so\\nlong in making.\\nI was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheelbarrow.  A basket\\nI could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that would\\nbend to make wicker-ware—at least, none yet found out; and as to a\\nwheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had no\\nnotion of; neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no\\npossible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the\\nwheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth\\nwhich I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the\\nlabourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers.  This was not\\nso difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel,\\nand the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no\\nless than four days—I mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun,\\nwhich I seldom failed, and very seldom failed also bringing home\\nsomething fit to eat.\\n_Nov._ 23.—My other work having now stood still, because of my making\\nthese tools, when they were finished I went on, and working every day, as\\nmy strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening\\nand deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously.\\n_Note_.—During all this time I worked to make this room or cave spacious\\nenough to accommodate me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a\\ndining-room, and a cellar.  As for my lodging, I kept to the tent; except\\nthat sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I\\ncould not keep myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover all my\\nplace within my pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning\\nagainst the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves of trees,\\nlike a thatch.\\n_December_ 10.—I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on a\\nsudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell\\ndown from the top on one side; so much that, in short, it frighted me,\\nand not without reason, too, for if I had been under it, I had never\\nwanted a gravedigger.  I had now a great deal of work to do over again,\\nfor I had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more\\nimportance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more\\nwould come down.\\n_Dec_. 11.—This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two\\nshores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of boards\\nacross over each post; this I finished the next day; and setting more\\nposts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured, and\\nthe posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off the\\nhouse.\\n_Dec._ 17.—From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up\\nnails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up; and now\\nI began to be in some order within doors.\\n_Dec._ 20.—Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish\\nmy house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my\\nvictuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me; also, I made\\nme another table.\\n_Dec._ 24.—Much rain all night and all day.  No stirring out.\\n_Dec._ 25.—Rain all day.\\n_Dec._ 26.—No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and\\npleasanter.\\n_Dec._ 27.—Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I caught it\\nand led it home in a string; when I had it at home, I bound and\\nsplintered up its leg, which was broke.\\n_N.B._—I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg grew well and as\\nstrong as ever; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon\\nthe little green at my door, and would not go away.  This was the first\\ntime that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures,\\nthat I might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.\\n_Dec._ 28, 29, 30.—Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no\\nstirring abroad except in the evening for food; this time I spent in\\nputting all my things in order within doors.\\n_January_ 1.—Very hot still: but I went abroad early and late with my\\ngun, and lay still in the middle of the day.  This evening, going farther\\ninto the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I found\\nthere were plenty of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at;\\nhowever, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.\\n_Jan._ 2.—Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him\\nupon the goats, but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the\\ndog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.\\n_Jan._ 3.—I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my\\nbeing attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.\\n_N.B._—This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said\\nin the journal; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time than\\nfrom the 2nd of January to the 14th of April working, finishing, and\\nperfecting this wall, though it was no more than about twenty-four yards\\nin length, being a half-circle from one place in the rock to another\\nplace, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the\\ncentre behind it.\\nAll this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me many days, nay,\\nsometimes weeks together; but I thought I should never be perfectly\\nsecure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what\\ninexpressible labour everything was done with, especially the bringing\\npiles out of the woods and driving them into the ground; for I made them\\nmuch bigger than I needed to have done.\\nWhen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, with a turf\\nwall raised up close to it, I perceived myself that if any people were to\\ncome on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a habitation;\\nand it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very\\nremarkable occasion.\\nDuring this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when\\nthe rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of\\nsomething or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild\\npigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but rather as\\nhouse-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I\\nendeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older\\nthey flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for\\nI had nothing to give them; however, I frequently found their nests, and\\ngot their young ones, which were very good meat.  And now, in the\\nmanaging my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things,\\nwhich I thought at first it was impossible for me to make; as, indeed,\\nwith some of them it was: for instance, I could never make a cask to be\\nhooped.  I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before; but I could\\nnever arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many\\nweeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join the staves so\\ntrue to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also over.\\nIn the next place, I was at a great loss for candles; so that as soon as\\never it was dark, which was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to\\ngo to bed.  I remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made candles in\\nmy African adventure; but I had none of that now; the only remedy I had\\nwas, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little\\ndish made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of\\nsome oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear,\\nsteady light, like a candle.  In the middle of all my labours it happened\\nthat, rummaging my things, I found a little bag which, as I hinted\\nbefore, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry—not for this\\nvoyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon.  The\\nlittle remainder of corn that had been in the bag was all devoured by the\\nrats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing\\nto have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder in, when\\nI divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I shook the\\nhusks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification, under the rock.\\nIt was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw\\nthis stuff away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I\\nhad thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I\\nsaw some few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground, which\\nI fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised, and\\nperfectly astonished, when, after a little longer time, I saw about ten\\nor twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, of the same\\nkind as our European—nay, as our English barley.\\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts\\non this occasion.  I had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at\\nall; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my head, nor had\\nentertained any sense of anything that had befallen me otherwise than as\\nchance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as\\ninquiring into the end of Providence in these things, or His order in\\ngoverning events for the world.  But after I saw barley grow there, in a\\nclimate which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I knew\\nnot how it came there, it startled me strangely, and I began to suggest\\nthat God had miraculously caused His grain to grow without any help of\\nseed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that\\nwild, miserable place.\\nThis touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes, and I\\nbegan to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my\\naccount; and this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it\\nstill, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks,\\nwhich proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen\\nit grow in Africa when I was ashore there.\\nI not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my\\nsupport, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all\\nover that part of the island, where I had been before, peering in every\\ncorner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find\\nany.  At last it occurred to my thoughts that I shook a bag of chickens’\\nmeat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease; and I must\\nconfess my religious thankfulness to God’s providence began to abate,\\ntoo, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common;\\nthough I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a\\nprovidence as if it had been miraculous; for it was really the work of\\nProvidence to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve grains\\nof corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the\\nrest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should throw\\nit out in that particular place, where, it being in the shade of a high\\nrock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else\\nat that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.\\nI carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their\\nseason, which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I\\nresolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity\\nsufficient to supply me with bread.  But it was not till the fourth year\\nthat I could allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even\\nthen but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards, in its order; for I lost\\nall that I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time; for I\\nsowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at\\nleast not as it would have done; of which in its place.\\nBesides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of\\nrice, which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to\\nthe same purpose—to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to\\ncook it without baking, though I did that also after some time.\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\nI worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;\\nand the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a\\ndoor but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the\\noutside of my habitation.\\n_April_ 16.—I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top,\\nand then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside.  This was\\na complete enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing\\ncould come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.\\nThe very next day after this wall was finished I had almost had all my\\nlabour overthrown at once, and myself killed.  The case was thus: As I\\nwas busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my\\ncave, I was terribly frighted with a most dreadful, surprising thing\\nindeed; for all on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from\\nthe roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two\\nof the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner.  I\\nwas heartily scared; but thought nothing of what was really the cause,\\nonly thinking that the top of my cave was fallen in, as some of it had\\ndone before: and for fear I should be buried in it I ran forward to my\\nladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall\\nfor fear of the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll down upon\\nme.  I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly\\nsaw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on shook three\\ntimes at about eight minutes’ distance, with three such shocks as would\\nhave overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have\\nstood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood\\nabout half a mile from me next the sea fell down with such a terrible\\nnoise as I never heard in all my life.  I perceived also the very sea was\\nput into violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger\\nunder the water than on the island.\\nI was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like,\\nnor discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or\\nstupefied; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one\\nthat was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock awakened\\nme, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in,\\nfilled me with horror; and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling\\nupon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once; and\\nthis sunk my very soul within me a second time.\\nAfter the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began\\nto take courage; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall again,\\nfor fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly\\ncast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do.  All this while I had\\nnot the least serious religious thought; nothing but the common “Lord\\nhave mercy upon me!” and when it was over that went away too.\\nWhile I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, as if it\\nwould rain.  Soon after that the wind arose by little and little, so that\\nin less than half-an-hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane; the sea was\\nall on a sudden covered over with foam and froth; the shore was covered\\nwith the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a\\nterrible storm it was.  This held about three hours, and then began to\\nabate; and in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very\\nhard.  All this while I sat upon the ground very much terrified and\\ndejected; when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and\\nrain being the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was\\nspent and over, and I might venture into my cave again.  With this\\nthought my spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade\\nme, I went in and sat down in my tent.  But the rain was so violent that\\nmy tent was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go into\\nmy cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on\\nmy head.  This violent rain forced me to a new work—viz. to cut a hole\\nthrough my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which\\nwould else have flooded my cave.  After I had been in my cave for some\\ntime, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to\\nbe more composed.  And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it\\nvery much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum; which,\\nhowever, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no\\nmore when that was gone.  It continued raining all that night and great\\npart of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being\\nmore composed, I began to think of what I had best do; concluding that if\\nthe island was subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for\\nme in a cave, but I must consider of building a little hut in an open\\nplace which I might surround with a wall, as I had done here, and so make\\nmyself secure from wild beasts or men; for I concluded, if I stayed where\\nI was, I should certainly one time or other be buried alive.\\nWith these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where it\\nstood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill; and which,\\nif it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent; and I\\nspent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving\\nwhere and how to remove my habitation.  The fear of being swallowed up\\nalive made me that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehension of\\nlying abroad without any fence was almost equal to it; but still, when I\\nlooked about, and saw how everything was put in order, how pleasantly\\nconcealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to\\nremove.  In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast\\ndeal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture\\nwhere I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so\\nas to remove to it.  So with this resolution I composed myself for a\\ntime, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a\\nwall with piles and cables, &c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent\\nup in it when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay where I\\nwas till it was finished, and fit to remove.  This was the 21st.\\n_April_ 22.—The next morning I begin to consider of means to put this\\nresolve into execution; but I was at a great loss about my tools.  I had\\nthree large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets\\nfor traffic with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty\\nhard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; and though I had a\\ngrindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too.  This cost me as\\nmuch thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of\\npolitics, or a judge upon the life and death of a man.  At length I\\ncontrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might\\nhave both my hands at liberty.  _Note_.—I had never seen any such thing\\nin England, or at least, not to take notice how it was done, though since\\nI have observed, it is very common there; besides that, my grindstone was\\nvery large and heavy.  This machine cost me a full week’s work to bring\\nit to perfection.\\n_April_ 28, 29.—These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my\\nmachine for turning my grindstone performing very well.\\n_April_ 30.—Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I\\ntook a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which\\nmade my heart very heavy.\\n_May_ 1.—In the morning, looking towards the sea side, the tide being\\nlow, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked\\nlike a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three\\npieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late\\nhurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to\\nlie higher out of the water than it used to do.  I examined the barrel\\nwhich was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder;\\nbut it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;\\nhowever, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on upon\\nthe sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for more.\\nCHAPTER VI—ILL AND CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN\\nWhen I came down to the ship I found it strangely removed.  The\\nforecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six\\nfeet, and the stern, which was broke in pieces and parted from the rest\\nby the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed\\nas it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand was thrown so high on\\nthat side next her stern, that whereas there was a great place of water\\nbefore, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck\\nwithout swimming I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out.\\nI was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be done by\\nthe earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was more broke open than\\nformerly, so many things came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened,\\nand which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.\\nThis wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my\\nhabitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in\\nsearching whether I could make any way into the ship; but I found nothing\\nwas to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was\\nchoked up with sand.  However, as I had learned not to despair of\\nanything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces that I could of the\\nship, concluding that everything I could get from her would be of some\\nuse or other to me.\\n_May_ 3.—I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which I\\nthought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I\\nhad cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the\\nside which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give\\nover for that time.\\n_May_ 4.—I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of,\\ntill I was weary of my sport; when, just going to leave off, I caught a\\nyoung dolphin.  I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no\\nhooks; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat;\\nall which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.\\n_May_ 5.—Worked on the wreck; cut another beam asunder, and brought three\\ngreat fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, and made to\\nfloat on shore when the tide of flood came on.\\n_May_ 6.—Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her and other\\npieces of ironwork.  Worked very hard, and came home very much tired, and\\nhad thoughts of giving it over.\\n_May_ 7.—Went to the wreck again, not with an intent to work, but found\\nthe weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut; that\\nseveral pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the\\nhold lay so open that I could see into it; but it was almost full of\\nwater and sand.\\n_May_ 8.—Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the\\ndeck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand.  I wrenched open\\ntwo planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide.  I left the\\niron crow in the wreck for next day.\\n_May_ 9.—Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of\\nthe wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but\\ncould not break them up.  I felt also a roll of English lead, and could\\nstir it, but it was too heavy to remove.\\n_May_ 10–14.—Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many pieces of\\ntimber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundredweight of iron.\\n_May_ 15.—I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off\\nthe roll of lead by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with\\nthe other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could\\nnot make any blow to drive the hatchet.\\n_May_ 16.—It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more\\nbroken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to\\nget pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that\\nday.\\n_May_ 17.—I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great\\ndistance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were, and\\nfound it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.\\n_May_ 24.—Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard\\nlabour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first\\nflowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen’s chests;\\nbut the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but\\npieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but\\nthe salt water and the sand had spoiled it.  I continued this work every\\nday to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I\\nalways appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide\\nwas up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I\\nhad got timber and plank and ironwork enough to have built a good boat,\\nif I had known how; and also I got, at several times and in several\\npieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead.\\n_June_ 16.—Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise or turtle.\\nThis was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune,\\nnot any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the\\nother side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as\\nI found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.\\n_June_ 17.—I spent in cooking the turtle.  I found in her three-score\\neggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and\\npleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats\\nand fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.\\n_June_ 18.—Rained all day, and I stayed within.  I thought at this time\\nthe rain felt cold, and I was something chilly; which I knew was not\\nusual in that latitude.\\n_June_ 19.—Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.\\n_June_ 20.—No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.\\n_June_ 21.—Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of\\nmy sad condition—to be sick, and no help.  Prayed to God, for the first\\ntime since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my\\nthoughts being all confused.\\n_June_ 22.—A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness.\\n_June_ 23.—Very bad again; cold and shivering, and then a violent\\nheadache.\\n_June_ 24.—Much better.\\n_June_ 25.—An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours; cold fit\\nand hot, with faint sweats after it.\\n_June_ 26.—Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found\\nmyself very weak.  However, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty\\ngot it home, and broiled some of it, and ate, I would fain have stewed\\nit, and made some broth, but had no pot.\\n_June_ 27.—The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and\\nneither ate nor drank.  I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I\\nhad not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.\\nPrayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so\\nignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, “Lord, look\\nupon me!  Lord, pity me!  Lord, have mercy upon me!”  I suppose I did\\nnothing else for two or three hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell\\nasleep, and did not wake till far in the night.  When I awoke, I found\\nmyself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty.  However, as I\\nhad no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went\\nto sleep again.  In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I\\nthought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall,\\nwhere I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a\\nman descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and\\nlight upon the ground.  He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I\\ncould but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most\\ninexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe.  When he\\nstepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just\\nas it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my\\napprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.  He was no\\nsooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a\\nlong spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a\\nrising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me—or I heard a voice so\\nterrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it.  All that I\\ncan say I understood was this: “Seeing all these things have not brought\\nthee to repentance, now thou shalt die;” at which words, I thought he\\nlifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.\\nNo one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be\\nable to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision.  I mean,\\nthat even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors.  Nor is\\nit any more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my\\nmind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.\\nI had, alas! no divine knowledge.  What I had received by the good\\ninstruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series,\\nfor eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation\\nwith none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last\\ndegree.  I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one thought that\\nso much as tended either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards\\ntowards a reflection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity of soul,\\nwithout desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed\\nme; and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked creature\\namong our common sailors can be supposed to be; not having the least\\nsense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God in\\ndeliverance.\\nIn the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more\\neasily believed when I shall add, that through all the variety of\\nmiseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one\\nthought of it being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for\\nmy sin—my rebellious behaviour against my father—or my present sins,\\nwhich were great—or so much as a punishment for the general course of my\\nwicked life.  When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores\\nof Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would become of me,\\nor one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from\\nthe danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious\\ncreatures as cruel savages.  But I was merely thoughtless of a God or a\\nProvidence, acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and\\nby the dictates of common sense only, and, indeed, hardly that.  When I\\nwas delivered and taken up at sea by the Portugal captain, well used, and\\ndealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the\\nleast thankfulness in my thoughts.  When, again, I was shipwrecked,\\nruined, and in danger of drowning on this island, I was as far from\\nremorse, or looking on it as a judgment.  I only said to myself often,\\nthat I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.\\nIt is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my ship’s crew\\ndrowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and\\nsome transports of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might have\\ncome up to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began, in a mere\\ncommon flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, without\\nthe least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which\\nhad preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all the\\nrest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful\\nunto me.  Even just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally\\nhave, after they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown\\nall in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over;\\nand all the rest of my life was like it.  Even when I was afterwards, on\\ndue consideration, made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on this\\ndreadful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of\\nrelief, or prospect of redemption, as soon as I saw but a prospect of\\nliving and that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense\\nof my affliction wore off; and I began to be very easy, applied myself to\\nthe works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough from\\nbeing afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from heaven, or as the\\nhand of God against me: these were thoughts which very seldom entered my\\nhead.\\nThe growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first some\\nlittle influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness, as\\nlong as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as ever\\nthat part of the thought was removed, all the impression that was raised\\nfrom it wore off also, as I have noted already.  Even the earthquake,\\nthough nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more immediately\\ndirecting to the invisible Power which alone directs such things, yet no\\nsooner was the first fright over, but the impression it had made went off\\nalso.  I had no more sense of God or His judgments—much less of the\\npresent affliction of my circumstances being from His hand—than if I had\\nbeen in the most prosperous condition of life.  But now, when I began to\\nbe sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came to place\\nitself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of a\\nstrong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the\\nfever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to\\nreproach myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by\\nuncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon\\nstrokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.  These\\nreflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper; and\\nin the violence, as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my\\nconscience, extorted some words from me like praying to God, though I\\ncannot say they were either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes:\\nit was rather the voice of mere fright and distress.  My thoughts were\\nconfused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in\\nsuch a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the mere\\napprehensions; and in these hurries of my soul I knew not what my tongue\\nmight express.  But it was rather exclamation, such as, “Lord, what a\\nmiserable creature am I!  If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for\\nwant of help; and what will become of me!”  Then the tears burst out of\\nmy eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.  In this interval the\\ngood advice of my father came to my mind, and presently his prediction,\\nwhich I mentioned at the beginning of this story—viz. that if I did take\\nthis foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would have leisure\\nhereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might\\nbe none to assist in my recovery.  “Now,” said I, aloud, “my dear\\nfather’s words are come to pass; God’s justice has overtaken me, and I\\nhave none to help or hear me.  I rejected the voice of Providence, which\\nhad mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I might\\nhave been happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself nor learn to\\nknow the blessing of it from my parents.  I left them to mourn over my\\nfolly, and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it.  I abused\\ntheir help and assistance, who would have lifted me in the world, and\\nwould have made everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to\\nstruggle with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no\\nassistance, no help, no comfort, no advice.”  Then I cried out, “Lord, be\\nmy help, for I am in great distress.”  This was the first prayer, if I\\nmay call it so, that I had made for many years.\\nBut to return to my Journal.\\n_June_ 28.—Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and\\nthe fit being entirely off, I got up; and though the fright and terror of\\nmy dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague would\\nreturn again the next day, and now was my time to get something to\\nrefresh and support myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I\\ndid, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my\\ntable, in reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish\\ndisposition of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it,\\nand mixed them together.  Then I got me a piece of the goat’s flesh and\\nbroiled it on the coals, but could eat very little.  I walked about, but\\nwas very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my\\nmiserable condition, dreading, the return of my distemper the next day.\\nAt night I made my supper of three of the turtle’s eggs, which I roasted\\nin the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, and this was the\\nfirst bit of meat I had ever asked God’s blessing to, that I could\\nremember, in my whole life.  After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found\\nmyself so weak that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out\\nwithout that; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,\\nlooking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and\\nsmooth.  As I sat here some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What\\nis this earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?  Whence is it\\nproduced?  And what am I, and all the other creatures wild and tame,\\nhuman and brutal?  Whence are we?  Sure we are all made by some secret\\nPower, who formed the earth and sea, the air and sky.  And who is that?\\nThen it followed most naturally, it is God that has made all.  Well, but\\nthen it came on strangely, if God has made all these things, He guides\\nand governs them all, and all things that concern them; for the Power\\nthat could make all things must certainly have power to guide and direct\\nthem.  If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His works,\\neither without His knowledge or appointment.\\nAnd if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here,\\nand am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing happens without His\\nappointment, He has appointed all this to befall me.  Nothing occurred to\\nmy thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and therefore it\\nrested upon me with the greater force, that it must needs be that God had\\nappointed all this to befall me; that I was brought into this miserable\\ncircumstance by His direction, He having the sole power, not of me only,\\nbut of everything that happened in the world.  Immediately it followed:\\nWhy has God done this to me?  What have I done to be thus used?  My\\nconscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed,\\nand methought it spoke to me like a voice: “Wretch! dost _thou_ ask what\\nthou hast done?  Look back upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself\\nwhat thou hast _not_ done?  Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago\\ndestroyed?  Why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads; killed in the\\nfight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured by the\\nwild beasts on the coast of Africa; or drowned _here_, when all the crew\\nperished but thyself?  Dost _thou_ ask, what have I done?”  I was struck\\ndumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had not a word to\\nsay—no, not to answer to myself, but rose up pensive and sad, walked back\\nto my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed;\\nbut my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep;\\nso I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.\\nNow, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very\\nmuch, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic but\\ntheir tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll of\\ntobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that\\nwas green, and not quite cured.\\nI went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure\\nboth for soul and body.  I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,\\nthe tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out\\none of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I had\\nnot found leisure or inclination to look into.  I say, I took it out, and\\nbrought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.  What use to make\\nof the tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good for it\\nor no: but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved it\\nshould hit one way or other.  I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it\\nin my mouth, which, indeed, at first almost stupefied my brain, the\\ntobacco being green and strong, and that I had not been much used to.\\nThen I took some and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved\\nto take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan\\nof coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I could\\nbear it, as well for the heat as almost for suffocation.  In the interval\\nof this operation I took up the Bible and began to read; but my head was\\ntoo much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that\\ntime; only, having opened the book casually, the first words that\\noccurred to me were these, “Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will\\ndeliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”  These words were very apt to\\nmy case, and made some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading\\nthem, though not so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being\\n_delivered_, the word had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so\\nremote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began to say,\\nas the children of Israel did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can\\nGod spread a table in the wilderness?” so I began to say, “Can God\\nHimself deliver me from this place?”  And as it was not for many years\\nthat any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but,\\nhowever, the words made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them\\nvery often.  It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my\\nhead so much that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the\\ncave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went to bed.  But\\nbefore I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life—I kneeled\\ndown, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called\\nupon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver me.  After my broken and\\nimperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the\\ntobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that I could\\nscarcely get it down; immediately upon this I went to bed.  I found\\npresently it flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a sound\\nsleep, and waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near\\nthree o’clock in the afternoon the next day—nay, to this hour I am partly\\nof opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three\\nthe day after; for otherwise I know not how I should lose a day out of my\\nreckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years after I had\\ndone; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line, I should\\nhave lost more than one day; but certainly I lost a day in my account,\\nand never knew which way.  Be that, however, one way or the other, when I\\nawaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and\\ncheerful; when I got up I was stronger than I was the day before, and my\\nstomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next\\nday, but continued much altered for the better.  This was the 29th.\\nThe 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but\\ndid not care to travel too far.  I killed a sea-fowl or two, something\\nlike a brandgoose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to eat\\nthem; so I ate some more of the turtle’s eggs, which were very good.\\nThis evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the\\nday before—the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as\\nbefore, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;\\nhowever, I was not so well the next day, which was the first of July, as\\nI hoped I should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but\\nit was not much.\\n_July_ 2.—I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself\\nwith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.\\n_July_ 3.—I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my\\nfull strength for some weeks after.  While I was thus gathering strength,\\nmy thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, “I will deliver thee”;\\nand the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of\\nmy ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such\\nthoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance\\nfrom the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had\\nreceived, and I was as it were made to ask myself such questions as\\nthese—viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from\\nsickness—from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was\\nso frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it?  Had I done my\\npart?  God had delivered me, but I had not glorified Him—that is to say,\\nI had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance; and how\\ncould I expect greater deliverance?  This touched my heart very much; and\\nimmediately I knelt down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from\\nmy sickness.\\n_July_ 4.—In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New\\nTestament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read\\na while every morning and every night; not tying myself to the number of\\nchapters, but long as my thoughts should engage me.  It was not long\\nafter I set seriously to this work till I found my heart more deeply and\\nsincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life.  The impression\\nof my dream revived; and the words, “All these things have not brought\\nthee to repentance,” ran seriously through my thoughts.  I was earnestly\\nbegging of God to give me repentance, when it happened providentially,\\nthe very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words: “He is\\nexalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give\\nremission.”  I threw down the book; and with my heart as well as my hands\\nlifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud,\\n“Jesus, thou son of David!  Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give\\nme repentance!”  This was the first time I could say, in the true sense\\nof the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with a sense\\nof my condition, and a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the\\nencouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I began\\nto hope that God would hear me.\\nNow I began to construe the words mentioned above, “Call on Me, and I\\nwill deliver thee,” in a different sense from what I had ever done\\nbefore; for then I had no notion of anything being called _deliverance_,\\nbut my being delivered from the captivity I was in; for though I was\\nindeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to\\nme, and that in the worse sense in the world.  But now I learned to take\\nit in another sense: now I looked back upon my past life with such\\nhorror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of\\nGod but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort.\\nAs for my solitary life, it was nothing.  I did not so much as pray to be\\ndelivered from it or think of it; it was all of no consideration in\\ncomparison to this.  And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall\\nread it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will\\nfind deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from\\naffliction.\\nBut, leaving this part, I return to my Journal.\\nMy condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way of\\nliving, yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed, by a\\nconstant reading the Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher\\nnature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which till now I knew\\nnothing of; also, my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to\\nfurnish myself with everything that I wanted, and make my way of living\\nas regular as I could.\\nFrom the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walking about\\nwith my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that\\nwas gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hardly\\nto be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced.  The\\napplication which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had\\nnever cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any to\\npractise, by this experiment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet it\\nrather contributed to weakening me; for I had frequent convulsions in my\\nnerves and limbs for some time.  I learned from it also this, in\\nparticular, that being abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious\\nthing to my health that could be, especially in those rains which came\\nattended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came\\nin the dry season was almost always accompanied with such storms, so I\\nfound that rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in\\nSeptember and October.\\nCHAPTER VII—AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCE\\nI had now been in this unhappy island above ten months.  All possibility\\nof deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;\\nand I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that\\nplace.  Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind,\\nI had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and\\nto see what other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.\\nIt was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey\\nof the island itself.  I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I\\nbrought my rafts on shore.  I found after I came about two miles up, that\\nthe tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little\\nbrook of running water, very fresh and good; but this being the dry\\nseason, there was hardly any water in some parts of it—at least not\\nenough to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived.  On the banks\\nof this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth,\\nand covered with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the\\nhigher grounds, where the water, as might be supposed, never overflowed,\\nI found a great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very\\nstrong stalk.  There were divers other plants, which I had no notion of\\nor understanding about, that might, perhaps, have virtues of their own,\\nwhich I could not find out.  I searched for the cassava root, which the\\nIndians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could find none.\\nI saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them.  I saw several\\nsugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect.  I\\ncontented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back,\\nmusing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and\\ngoodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover, but\\ncould bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little\\nobservation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants\\nin the field; at least, very little that might serve to any purpose now\\nin my distress.\\nThe next day, the sixteenth, I went up the same way again; and after\\ngoing something further than I had gone the day before, I found the brook\\nand the savannahs cease, and the country become more woody than before.\\nIn this part I found different fruits, and particularly I found melons\\nupon the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees.  The\\nvines had spread, indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were\\njust now in their prime, very ripe and rich.  This was a surprising\\ndiscovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warned by my\\nexperience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when I was ashore\\nin Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who\\nwere slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers.  But I found\\nan excellent use for these grapes; and that was, to cure or dry them in\\nthe sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I\\nthought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and agreeable to eat\\nwhen no grapes could be had.\\nI spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation;\\nwhich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from\\nhome.  In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree,\\nwhere I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery;\\ntravelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the\\nvalley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and\\nnorth side of me.  At the end of this march I came to an opening where\\nthe country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh\\nwater, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way,\\nthat is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so\\nflourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring\\nthat it looked like a planted garden.  I descended a little on the side\\nof that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure,\\nthough mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that this was\\nall my own; that I was king and lord of all this country indefensibly,\\nand had a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it\\nin inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England.  I saw\\nhere abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but\\nall wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then.  However,\\nthe green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very\\nwholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it\\nvery wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.  I found now I had business\\nenough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store as well\\nof grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season,\\nwhich I knew was approaching.  In order to do this, I gathered a great\\nheap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great\\nparcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each\\nwith me, I travelled homewards; resolving to come again, and bring a bag\\nor sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.  Accordingly,\\nhaving spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call\\nmy tent and my cave); but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled;\\nthe richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken them\\nand bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the limes,\\nthey were good, but I could bring but a few.\\nThe next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two small\\nbags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming to my\\nheap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find\\nthem all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some\\nthere, and abundance eaten and devoured.  By this I concluded there were\\nsome wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were\\nI knew not.  However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,\\nand no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be\\ndestroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight,\\nI took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and\\nhung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in\\nthe sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I\\ncould well stand under.\\nWhen I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure\\nthe fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;\\nthe security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and\\nconcluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by\\nfar the worst part of the country.  Upon the whole, I began to consider\\nof removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as\\nwhere now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of\\nthe island.\\nThis thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some\\ntime, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came to a\\nnearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside, where it\\nwas at least possible that something might happen to my advantage, and,\\nby the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other\\nunhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable\\nthat any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the\\nhills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage,\\nand to render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible; and\\nthat therefore I ought not by any means to remove.  However, I was so\\nenamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole\\nof the remaining part of the month of July; and though upon second\\nthoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a\\nbower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a\\ndouble hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled between\\nwith brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights\\ntogether; always going over it with a ladder; so that I fancied now I had\\nmy country house and my sea-coast house; and this work took me up to the\\nbeginning of August.\\nI had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when the\\nrains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for though\\nI had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread\\nit very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,\\nnor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.\\nAbout the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and\\nbegan to enjoy myself.  The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung\\nup perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the sun;\\nso I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that I\\ndid so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I had\\nlost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large\\nbunches of them.  No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried the\\nmost of them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and from hence,\\nwhich was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the\\nmiddle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out\\nof my cave for several days.\\nIn this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I had\\nbeen concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,\\nas I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her till, to\\nmy astonishment, she came home about the end of August with three\\nkittens.  This was the more strange to me because, though I had killed a\\nwild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a\\ndifferent kind from our European cats; but the young cats were the same\\nkind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being females, I\\nthought it very strange.  But from these three cats I afterwards came to\\nbe so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill them like vermin or\\nwild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.\\nFrom the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not\\nstir, and was now very careful not to be much wet.  In this confinement,\\nI began to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one day\\nkilled a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large\\ntortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate\\na bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat’s flesh, or of\\nthe turtle, for my dinner, broiled—for, to my great misfortune, I had no\\nvessel to boil or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle’s eggs\\nfor my supper.\\nDuring this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or\\nthree hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one\\nside, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,\\nwhich came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way.\\nBut I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed\\nmyself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I thought I lay\\nexposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not\\nperceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature\\nthat I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.\\n_Sept._ 30.—I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.  I\\ncast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three\\nhundred and sixty-five days.  I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting\\nit apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with\\nthe most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging\\nHis righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me\\nthrough Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for\\ntwelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a\\nbiscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as\\nI began it.  I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first\\nI had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted\\nto distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the\\nSabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days were; but\\nnow, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there a year;\\nso I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a\\nSabbath; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a day or two\\nin my reckoning.  A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I\\ncontented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the\\nmost remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum\\nof other things.\\nThe rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,\\nand I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I\\nbought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to relate\\nwas one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.\\nI have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice, which\\nI had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I\\nbelieve there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of\\nbarley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains,\\nthe sun being in its southern position, going from me.  Accordingly, I\\ndug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and\\ndividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it\\ncasually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first,\\nbecause I did not know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about\\ntwo-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.  It was a great\\ncomfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed\\nthis time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth\\nhaving had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist\\nits growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again,\\nand then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.  Finding my first seed\\ndid not grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a\\nmoister piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of\\nground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a\\nlittle before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of\\nMarch and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a\\nvery good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to\\nsow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not\\namounting to above half a peck of each kind.  But by this experiment I\\nwas made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper season\\nwas to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and two harvests every\\nyear.\\nWhile this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use\\nto me afterwards.  As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began\\nto settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the\\ncountry to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I\\nfound all things just as I left them.  The circle or double hedge that I\\nhad made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out\\nof some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long\\nbranches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after\\nlopping its head.  I could not tell what tree to call it that these\\nstakes were cut from.  I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see\\nthe young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much\\nalike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they\\ngrew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about\\ntwenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call\\nthem, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge\\nunder all the dry season.  This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,\\nand make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle round my wall (I mean\\nthat of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes\\nin a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they\\ngrew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and\\nafterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.\\nI found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not\\ninto summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the\\ndry seasons, which were generally thus:—The half of February, the whole\\nof March, and the half of April—rainy, the sun being then on or near the\\nequinox.\\nThe half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of\\nAugust—dry, the sun being then to the north of the line.\\nThe half of August, the whole of September, and the half of\\nOctober—rainy, the sun being then come back.\\nThe half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and\\nthe half of February—dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.\\nThe rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened\\nto blow, but this was the general observation I made.  After I had found\\nby experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took\\ncare to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be\\nobliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during the\\nwet months.  This time I found much employment, and very suitable also to\\nthe time, for I found great occasion for many things which I had no way\\nto furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application;\\nparticularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs\\nI could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing.\\nIt proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used\\nto take great delight in standing at a basket-maker’s, in the town where\\nmy father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys\\nusually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner\\nin which they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by\\nthese means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but\\nthe materials, when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from\\nwhence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the\\nsallows, willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try.\\nAccordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and\\ncutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as\\nI could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to\\ncut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of\\nthem.  These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they\\nwere fit for use I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next\\nseason, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many\\nbaskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had\\noccasion; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made\\nthem sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took\\ncare never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made\\nmore, especially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of\\nsacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.\\nHaving mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it, I\\nbestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants.  I had no\\nvessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which were\\nalmost full of rum, and some glass bottles—some of the common size, and\\nothers which were case bottles, square, for the holding of water,\\nspirits, &c.  I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great\\nkettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such as\\nI desired it—viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.  The\\nsecond thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was\\nimpossible to me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for that,\\ntoo, at last.  I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or\\npiles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when\\nanother business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could\\nspare.\\nCHAPTER VIII—SURVEYS HIS POSITION\\nI mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and\\nthat I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,\\nand where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the\\nisland.  I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that\\nside; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of\\npowder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of\\nraisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey.  When I had passed\\nthe vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea to\\nthe west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land—whether\\nan island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high,\\nextending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess\\nit could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.\\nI could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than\\nthat I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my\\nobservations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all\\ninhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been in a worse\\ncondition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions\\nof Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered everything\\nfor the best; I say I quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting\\nmyself with fruitless wishes of being there.\\nBesides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if this\\nland was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see\\nsome vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the\\nsavage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are found the\\nworst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to\\nmurder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.\\nWith these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward.  I found that\\nside of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine—the open or\\nsavannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very\\nfine woods.  I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught\\none, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to\\nme.  I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked\\nit down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it\\nwas some years before I could make him speak; however, at last I taught\\nhim to call me by name very familiarly.  But the accident that followed,\\nthough it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.\\nI was exceedingly diverted with this journey.  I found in the low grounds\\nhares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed greatly from\\nall the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat\\nthem, though I killed several.  But I had no need to be venturous, for I\\nhad no want of food, and of that which was very good too, especially\\nthese three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which\\nadded to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have furnished a table\\nbetter than I, in proportion to the company; and though my case was\\ndeplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness that I was not\\ndriven to any extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to\\ndainties.\\nI never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or\\nthereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see what\\ndiscoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I\\nresolved to sit down all night; and then I either reposed myself in a\\ntree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the\\nground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could\\ncome at me without waking me.\\nAs soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had\\ntaken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the\\nshore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I\\nhad found but three in a year and a half.  Here was also an infinite\\nnumber of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I\\nhad not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I knew\\nnot the names of, except those called penguins.\\nI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my powder\\nand shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat if I could,\\nwhich I could better feed on; and though there were many goats here, more\\nthan on my side the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I\\ncould come near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me\\nmuch sooner than when I was on the hills.\\nI confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but yet\\nI had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my\\nhabitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here\\nto be as it were upon a journey, and from home.  However, I travelled\\nalong the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve\\nmiles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I\\nconcluded I would go home again, and that the next journey I took should\\nbe on the other side of the island east from my dwelling, and so round\\ntill I came to my post again.\\nI took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily\\nkeep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss finding my\\nfirst dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken, for\\nbeing come about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very\\nlarge valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with\\nwood, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that of\\nthe sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun\\nat that time of the day.  It happened, to my further misfortune, that the\\nweather proved hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and\\nnot being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and\\nat last was obliged to find the seaside, look for my post, and come back\\nthe same way I went: and then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the\\nweather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other\\nthings very heavy.\\nIn this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and I,\\nrunning in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the\\ndog.  I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often\\nbeen musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so\\nraise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and\\nshot should be all spent.  I made a collar for this little creature, and\\nwith a string, which I made of some rope-yam, which I always carried\\nabout me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my\\nbower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to\\nbe at home, from whence I had been absent above a month.\\nI cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old\\nhutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed.  This little wandering journey,\\nwithout settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own\\nhouse, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared\\nto that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I\\nresolved I would never go a great way from it again while it should be my\\nlot to stay on the island.\\nI reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long\\njourney; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair\\nof making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to\\nbe well acquainted with me.  Then I began to think of the poor kid which\\nI had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it\\nhome, or give it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left\\nit, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for want of\\nfood.  I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I\\ncould find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did\\nbefore, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had\\nno need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I\\ncontinually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so\\nfond, that it became from that time one of my domestics also, and would\\nnever leave me afterwards.\\nThe rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the\\n30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the\\nanniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there two years,\\nand no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I came there,\\nI spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many\\nwonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and\\nwithout which it might have been infinitely more miserable.  I gave\\nhumble and hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me that\\nit was possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition than I\\nshould have been in the liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of\\nthe world; that He could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my\\nsolitary state, and the want of human society, by His presence and the\\ncommunications of His grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and\\nencouraging me to depend upon His providence here, and hope for His\\neternal presence hereafter.\\nIt was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life I\\nnow led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,\\ncursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days; and now I\\nchanged both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my\\naffections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from\\nwhat they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.\\nBefore, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing the\\ncountry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me\\non a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the\\nwoods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner,\\nlocked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited\\nwilderness, without redemption.  In the midst of the greatest composure\\nof my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring\\nmy hands and weep like a child.  Sometimes it would take me in the middle\\nof my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the\\nground for an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for\\nif I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go\\noff, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.\\nBut now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the\\nword of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.  One\\nmorning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, “I will\\nnever, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”  Immediately it occurred that\\nthese words were to me; why else should they be directed in such a\\nmanner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one\\nforsaken of God and man?  “Well, then,” said I, “if God does not forsake\\nme, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the\\nworld should all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the\\nworld, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no\\ncomparison in the loss?”\\nFrom this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for\\nme to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it was\\nprobable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the\\nworld; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for\\nbringing me to this place.  I know not what it was, but something shocked\\nmy mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.  “How canst\\nthou become such a hypocrite,” said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be\\nthankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be\\ncontented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?”\\nSo I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God for being\\nthere, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by\\nwhatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life,\\nand to mourn for my wickedness, and repent.  I never opened the Bible, or\\nshut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend\\nin England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and\\nfor assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.\\nThus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and though\\nI have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my\\nworks this year as the first, yet in general it may be observed that I\\nwas very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my time according to\\nthe several daily employments that were before me, such as: first, my\\nduty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart\\nsome time for thrice every day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun\\nfor food, which generally took me up three hours in every morning, when\\nit did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking\\nwhat I had killed or caught for my supply; these took up great part of\\nthe day.  Also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day,\\nwhen the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to\\nstir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I\\ncould be supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I\\nchanged my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning,\\nand abroad with my gun in the afternoon.\\nTo this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the exceeding\\nlaboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools, want\\nof help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time.  For\\nexample, I was full two and forty days in making a board for a long\\nshelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with their tools\\nand a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a\\nday.\\nMy case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down,\\nbecause my board was to be a broad one.  This tree I was three days in\\ncutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a\\nlog or piece of timber.  With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduced\\nboth the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to move;\\nthen I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from\\nend to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other side til I\\nbrought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both\\nsides.  Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work;\\nbut labour and patience carried me through that, and many other things.\\nI only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my\\ntime went away with so little work—viz. that what might be a little to be\\ndone with help and tools, was a vast labour and required a prodigious\\ntime to do alone, and by hand.  But notwithstanding this, with patience\\nand labour I got through everything that my circumstances made necessary\\nto me to do, as will appear by what follows.\\nI was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of\\nbarley and rice.  The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not\\ngreat; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of\\nhalf a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season.\\nBut now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in\\ndanger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was\\nscarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and wild\\ncreatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade,\\nlay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that\\nit could get no time to shoot up into stalk.\\nThis I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a\\nhedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it\\nrequired speed.  However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my\\ncrop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks’ time; and\\nshooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it\\nin the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand\\nand bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the\\nplace, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.\\nBut as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so\\nthe birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for,\\ngoing along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop\\nsurrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it\\nwere, watching till I should be gone.  I immediately let fly among them,\\nfor I always had my gun with me.  I had no sooner shot, but there rose up\\na little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn\\nitself.\\nThis touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would\\ndevour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be able to raise\\na crop at all; and what to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not\\nto lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.  In\\nthe first place, I went among it to see what damage was already done, and\\nfound they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too\\ngreen for them, the loss was not so great but that the remainder was\\nlikely to be a good crop if it could be saved.\\nI stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see\\nthe thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited\\ntill I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked\\noff, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they\\ndropped down one by one into the corn again.  I was so provoked, that I\\ncould not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every\\ngrain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in\\nthe consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed\\nthree of them.  This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served\\nthem as we serve notorious thieves in England—hanged them in chains, for\\na terror to others.  It is impossible to imagine that this should have\\nsuch an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at the\\ncorn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island, and I\\ncould never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung\\nthere.  This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter\\nend of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my\\ncorn.\\nI was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I\\ncould do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the\\nbroadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship.\\nHowever, as my first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut\\nit down; in short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut nothing off but the\\nears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so\\nrubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found\\nthat out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and\\nabout two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, for\\nI had no measure at that time.\\nHowever, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in\\ntime, it would please God to supply me with bread.  And yet here I was\\nperplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn,\\nor indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to\\nmake bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it.\\nThese things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for\\nstore, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of\\nthis crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and in\\nthe meantime to employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish\\nthis great work of providing myself with corn and bread.\\nIt might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.  I believe few\\npeople have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things\\nnecessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and\\nfinishing this one article of bread.\\nI, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily\\ndiscouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after I\\nhad got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up\\nunexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.\\nFirst, I had no plough to turn up the earth—no spade or shovel to dig it.\\nWell, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed before;\\nbut this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a\\ngreat many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out\\nsoon, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse.\\nHowever, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with patience,\\nand bear with the badness of the performance.  When the corn was sown, I\\nhad no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great\\nheavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather\\nthan rake or harrow it.  When it was growing, and grown, I have observed\\nalready how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it,\\ncure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it.\\nThen I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to\\nmake it into bread, and an oven to bake it; but all these things I did\\nwithout, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable\\ncomfort and advantage to me too.  All this, as I said, made everything\\nlaborious and tedious to me; but that there was no help for.  Neither was\\nmy time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part\\nof it was every day appointed to these works; and as I had resolved to\\nuse none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had\\nthe next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to\\nfurnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations\\nnecessary for making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.\\nCHAPTER IX—A BOAT\\nBut first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow\\nabove an acre of ground.  Before I did this, I had a week’s work at least\\nto make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed,\\nand very heavy, and required double labour to work with it.  However, I\\ngot through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground,\\nas near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with\\na good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had\\nset before, and knew it would grow; so that, in a year’s time, I knew I\\nshould have a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair.\\nThis work did not take me up less than three months, because a great part\\nof that time was the wet season, when I could not go abroad.\\nWithin-doors, that is when it rained and I could not go out, I found\\nemployment in the following occupations—always observing, that all the\\nwhile I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and\\nteaching him to speak; and I quickly taught him to know his own name, and\\nat last to speak it out pretty loud, “Poll,” which was the first word I\\never heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.  This,\\ntherefore, was not my work, but an assistance to my work; for now, as I\\nsaid, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long\\nstudied to make, by some means or other, some earthen vessels, which,\\nindeed, I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them.  However,\\nconsidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find\\nout any clay, I might make some pots that might, being dried in the sun,\\nbe hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything\\nthat was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in\\nthe preparing corn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was doing, I\\nresolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like\\njars, to hold what should be put into them.\\nIt would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many\\nawkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly things\\nI made; how many of them fell in and how many fell out, the clay not\\nbeing stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the\\nover-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many\\nfell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were\\ndried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the\\nclay—to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it—I could not\\nmake above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in\\nabout two months’ labour.\\nHowever, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them very\\ngently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which I\\nhad made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as between\\nthe pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it\\nfull of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand\\nalways dry I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when\\nthe corn was bruised.\\nThough I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made\\nseveral smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,\\nflat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to; and\\nthe heat of the sun baked them quite hard.\\nBut all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot to\\nhold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could do.\\nIt happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my\\nmeat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a\\nbroken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard\\nas a stone, and red as a tile.  I was agreeably surprised to see it, and\\nsaid to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they\\nwould burn broken.\\nThis set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some\\npots.  I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of\\nglazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I\\nplaced three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon\\nanother, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of embers\\nunder them.  I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon\\nthe top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and\\nobserved that they did not crack at all.  When I saw them clear red, I\\nlet them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of\\nthem, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was\\nmixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would have\\nrun into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the\\npots began to abate of the red colour; and watching them all night, that\\nI might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very\\ngood (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as\\nhard burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the\\nrunning of the sand.\\nAfter this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of\\nearthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of them,\\nthey were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of\\nmaking them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make\\npies that never learned to raise paste.\\nNo joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I\\nfound I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had\\nhardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set one on the fire\\nagain with some water in it to boil me some meat, which it did admirably\\nwell; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I\\nwanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it as\\ngood as I would have had it been.\\nMy next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn\\nin; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that\\nperfection of art with one pair of hands.  To supply this want, I was at\\na great loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly\\nunqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any\\ntools to go about it with.  I spent many a day to find out a great stone\\nbig enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none\\nat all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig\\nor cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness\\nsufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would\\nbear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without\\nfilling it with sand.  So, after a great deal of time lost in searching\\nfor a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block\\nof hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and getting one as big\\nas I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside\\nwith my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of fire and infinite\\nlabour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their\\ncanoes.  After this, I made a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood\\ncalled the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my\\nnext crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound\\ninto meal to make bread.\\nMy next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my meal, and\\nto part it from the bran and the husk; without which I did not see it\\npossible I could have any bread.  This was a most difficult thing even to\\nthink on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make\\nit—I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through.  And here\\nI was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do.\\nLinen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat’s hair, but\\nneither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here were\\nno tools to work it with.  All the remedy that I found for this was, that\\nat last I did remember I had, among the seamen’s clothes which were saved\\nout of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some\\npieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough for the work; and\\nthus I made shift for some years: how I did afterwards, I shall show in\\nits place.\\nThe baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should\\nmake bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no yeast.  As to\\nthat part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself\\nmuch about it.  But for an oven I was indeed in great pain.  At length I\\nfound out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some\\nearthen-vessels very broad but not deep, that is to say, about two feet\\ndiameter, and not above nine inches deep.  These I burned in the fire, as\\nI had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made\\na great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles of\\nmy own baking and burning also; but I should not call them square.\\nWhen the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals, I\\ndrew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there\\nI let them lie till the hearth was very hot.  Then sweeping away all the\\nembers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot\\nupon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in\\nand add to the heat; and thus as well as in the best oven in the world, I\\nbaked my barley-loaves, and became in little time a good pastrycook into\\nthe bargain; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice;\\nbut I made no pies, neither had I anything to put into them supposing I\\nhad, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.\\nIt need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of\\nthe third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed that in the\\nintervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;\\nfor I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I\\ncould, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to\\nrub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash\\nit with.\\nAnd now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build my\\nbarns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of the\\ncorn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty\\nbushels, and of the rice as much or more; insomuch that now I resolved to\\nbegin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while;\\nalso I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole\\nyear, and to sow but once a year.\\nUpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were\\nmuch more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the\\nsame quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a\\nquantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.\\nAll the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran\\nmany times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side\\nof the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on shore\\nthere, fancying that, seeing the mainland, and an inhabited country, I\\nmight find some way or other to convey myself further, and perhaps at\\nlast find some means of escape.\\nBut all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an\\nundertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps\\nsuch as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers\\nof Africa: that if I once came in their power, I should run a hazard of\\nmore than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;\\nfor I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals or\\nman-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could not be far from that\\nshore.  Then, supposing they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me,\\nas many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even\\nwhen they had been ten or twenty together—much more I, that was but one,\\nand could make little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I\\nought to have considered well; and did come into my thoughts afterwards,\\nyet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the\\nthought of getting over to the shore.\\nNow I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton\\nsail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa;\\nbut this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s\\nboat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in\\nthe storm, when we were first cast away.  She lay almost where she did at\\nfirst, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the\\nwinds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand,\\nbut no water about her.  If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to\\nhave launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,\\nand I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I\\nmight have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright\\nupon her bottom than I could remove the island; however, I went to the\\nwoods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat resolving\\nto try what I could do; suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her\\ndown, I might repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very\\ngood boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.\\nI spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I\\nthink, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to\\nheave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to\\nundermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to\\nthrust and guide it right in the fall.\\nBut when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get\\nunder it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was forced\\nto give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my\\ndesire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, as\\nthe means for it seemed impossible.\\nThis at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make\\nmyself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make,\\neven without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a\\ngreat tree.  This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased\\nmyself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much\\nmore convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at\\nall considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than\\nthe Indians did—viz. want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the\\nwater—a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the\\nconsequences of want of tools could be to them; for what was it to me, if\\nwhen I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it\\ndown, if I had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into\\nthe proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it\\nhollow, so as to make a boat of it—if, after all this, I must leave it\\njust there where I found it, and not be able to launch it into the water?\\nOne would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon my\\nmind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should have\\nimmediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts\\nwere so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once\\nconsidered how I should get it off the land: and it was really, in its\\nown nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea\\nthan about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in\\nthe water.\\nI went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did who\\nhad any of his senses awake.  I pleased myself with the design, without\\ndetermining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that the\\ndifficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop\\nto my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself—“Let\\nme first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along\\nwhen it is done.”\\nThis was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy\\nprevailed, and to work I went.  I felled a cedar-tree, and I question\\nmuch whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple\\nof Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next\\nthe stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two\\nfeet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches.\\nIt was not without infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty\\ndays hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting\\nthe branches and limbs and the vast spreading head cut off, which I\\nhacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour;\\nafter this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion,\\nand to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as\\nit ought to do.  It cost me near three months more to clear the inside,\\nand work it out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did, indeed,\\nwithout fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,\\ntill I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to\\nhave carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to have\\ncarried me and all my cargo.\\nWhen I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with it.  The\\nboat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua, that was\\nmade of one tree, in my life.  Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may\\nbe sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question, but I\\nshould have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be\\nperformed, that ever was undertaken.\\nBut all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost\\nme infinite labour too.  It lay about one hundred yards from the water,\\nand not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the\\ncreek.  Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into\\nthe surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began, and it\\ncost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains who have their\\ndeliverance in view?); but when this was worked through, and this\\ndifficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more stir\\nthe canoe than I could the other boat.  Then I measured the distance of\\nground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the\\ncanoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water.  Well, I\\nbegan this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how\\ndeep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I\\nfound that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must\\nhave been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through with it;\\nfor the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at\\nleast twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctancy, I\\ngave this attempt over also.\\nThis grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of\\nbeginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of\\nour own strength to go through with it.\\nIn the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and\\nkept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as\\never before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the Word\\nof God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different\\nknowledge from what I had before.  I entertained different notions of\\nthings.  I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had\\nnothing to do with, no expectations from, and, indeed, no desires about:\\nin a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to\\nhave, so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it\\nhereafter—viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and\\nwell might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, “Between me and thee is a\\ngreat gulf fixed.”\\nIn the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world\\nhere; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor the\\npride of life.  I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now\\ncapable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I\\nmight call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had\\npossession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute\\nsovereignty or command with me: I might have raised ship-loadings of\\ncorn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought\\nenough for my occasion.  I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and\\nthen one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber enough to\\nhave built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine,\\nor to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been\\nbuilt.\\nBut all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to\\neat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me?  If I killed\\nmore flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed\\nmore corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down\\nwere lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them but for\\nfuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.\\nIn a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just\\nreflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther good to\\nus than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up to give\\nothers, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more.  The most\\ncovetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of\\ncovetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more\\nthan I knew what to do with.  I had no room for desire, except it was of\\nthings which I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of\\ngreat use to me.  I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well\\ngold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.  Alas! there the sorry,\\nuseless stuff lay; I had no more manner of business for it; and often\\nthought with myself that I would have given a handful of it for a gross\\nof tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have\\ngiven it all for a sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of\\nEngland, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink.  As it\\nwas, I had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it; but there it\\nlay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet\\nseasons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the\\nsame case—they had been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.\\nI had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it\\nwas at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body.  I\\nfrequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of\\nGod’s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness.  I\\nlearned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon\\nthe dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted;\\nand this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express\\nthem; and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people\\nin mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them,\\nbecause they see and covet something that He has not given them.  All our\\ndiscontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of\\nthankfulness for what we have.\\nAnother reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to\\nany one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was, to\\ncompare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be;\\nnay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of\\nGod had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the\\nshore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out\\nof her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I had\\nwanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for\\ngetting my food.\\nI spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in\\nthe most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out\\nof the ship.  How I could not have so much as got any food, except fish\\nand turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must\\nhave perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not perished,\\nlike a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any\\ncontrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the\\nskin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and\\npull it with my claws, like a beast.\\nThese reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to\\nme, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships\\nand misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend to the\\nreflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, “Is any\\naffliction like mine?”  Let them consider how much worse the cases of\\nsome people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had\\nthought fit.\\nI had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with\\nhopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had\\ndeserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence.\\nI had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and\\nfear of God.  I had been well instructed by father and mother; neither\\nhad they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse a\\nreligious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the\\nnature and end of my being required of me.  But, alas! falling early into\\nthe seafaring life, which of all lives is the most destitute of the fear\\nof God, though His terrors are always before them; I say, falling early\\ninto the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little\\nsense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my\\nmessmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death,\\nwhich grew habitual to me by my long absence from all manner of\\nopportunities to converse with anything but what was like myself, or to\\nhear anything that was good or tended towards it.\\nSo void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of what I\\nwas, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed—such as\\nmy escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of the\\nship; my being planted so well in the Brazils; my receiving the cargo\\nfrom England, and the like—I never had once the words “Thank God!” so\\nmuch as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so\\nmuch as a thought to pray to Him, or so much as to say, “Lord, have mercy\\nupon me!” no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by,\\nand blaspheme it.\\nI had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have\\nalready observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and\\nwhen I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had\\nattended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt\\nbountifully with me—had not only punished me less than my iniquity had\\ndeserved, but had so plentifully provided for me—this gave me great hopes\\nthat my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for\\nme.\\nWith these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation to\\nthe will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but even\\nto a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet a\\nliving man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of\\nmy sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have\\nexpected in that place; that I ought never more to repine at my\\ncondition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread,\\nwhich nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought to\\nconsider I had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of\\nfeeding Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles; and that I\\ncould hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world\\nwhere I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I\\nhad no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no\\nravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no\\nvenomous creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt; no\\nsavages to murder and devour me.  In a word, as my life was a life of\\nsorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing\\nto make it a life of comfort but to be able to make my sense of God’s\\ngoodness to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily\\nconsolation; and after I did make a just improvement on these things, I\\nwent away, and was no more sad.  I had now been here so long that many\\nthings which I had brought on shore for my help were either quite gone,\\nor very much wasted and near spent.\\nMy ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,\\nwhich I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale,\\nit scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.  As long as it\\nlasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any\\nremarkable thing happened to me; and first, by casting up times past, I\\nremembered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various\\nprovidences which befell me, and which, if I had been superstitiously\\ninclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason\\nto have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.\\nFirst, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from my father\\nand friends and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day\\nafterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the\\nsame day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in\\nYarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from\\nSallee in a boat; the same day of the year I was born on—viz. the 30th of\\nSeptember, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six\\nyears after, when I was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked\\nlife and my solitary life began both on a day.\\nThe next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread—I mean the\\nbiscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the last\\ndegree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a-day for above a year; and\\nyet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of my\\nown, and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the\\ngetting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.\\nMy clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a good\\nwhile, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the\\nother seamen, and which I carefully preserved; because many times I could\\nbear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me\\nthat I had, among all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost three dozen\\nof shirts.  There were also, indeed, several thick watch-coats of the\\nseamen’s which were left, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is\\ntrue that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of\\nclothes, yet I could not go quite naked—no, though I had been inclined to\\nit, which I was not—nor could I abide the thought of it, though I was\\nalone.  The reason why I could not go naked was, I could not bear the\\nheat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on; nay,\\nthe very heat frequently blistered my skin: whereas, with a shirt on, the\\nair itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold\\ncooler than without it.  No more could I ever bring myself to go out in\\nthe heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating\\nwith such violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache\\npresently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so\\nthat I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat it would presently\\ngo away.\\nUpon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,\\nwhich I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the\\nwaistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make\\njackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such\\nother materials as I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed,\\nbotching, for I made most piteous work of it.  However, I made shift to\\nmake two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great\\nwhile: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed\\ntill afterwards.\\nI have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I\\nkilled, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up, stretched out\\nwith sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard\\nthat they were fit for little, but others were very useful.  The first\\nthing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the\\noutside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well, that after\\nI made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins—that is to say, a\\nwaistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for they were\\nrather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm.  I must not omit to\\nacknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,\\nI was a worse tailor.  However, they were such as I made very good shift\\nwith, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the hair of my\\nwaistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.\\nAfter this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella; I\\nwas, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one; I\\nhad seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the\\ngreat heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and\\ngreater too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be\\nmuch abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as\\nthe heats.  I took a world of pains with it, and was a great while before\\nI could make anything likely to hold: nay, after I had thought I had hit\\nthe way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind: but at last\\nI made one that answered indifferently well: the main difficulty I found\\nwas to make it let down.  I could make it spread, but if it did not let\\ndown too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but just over\\nmy head, which would not do.  However, at last, as I said, I made one to\\nanswer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off\\nthe rain like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I\\ncould walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than\\nI could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it could close\\nit, and carry it under my arm.\\nThus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by\\nresigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the\\ndisposal of His providence.  This made my life better than sociable, for\\nwhen I began to regret the want of conversation I would ask myself,\\nwhether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I\\nmay say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the\\nutmost enjoyment of human society in the world?\\nCHAPTER X—TAMES GOATS\\nI cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing\\nhappened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture\\nand place, as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my\\nyearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of\\nboth which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one\\nyear’s provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my\\ndaily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a\\ncanoe, which at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of six\\nfeet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a\\nmile.  As for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it without\\nconsidering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should be able to\\nlaunch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or bring the\\nwater to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was as a memorandum to\\nteach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next time, though I could\\nnot get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get\\nthe water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near half a\\nmile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and\\nthough I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in\\nhopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.\\nHowever, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was\\nnot at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the\\nfirst; I mean of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was above\\nforty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put\\nan end to that design, and now I thought no more of it.  As I had a boat,\\nmy next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had been\\non the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it,\\nover the land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey made me\\nvery eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I\\nthought of nothing but sailing round the island.\\nFor this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and\\nconsideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail too\\nout of some of the pieces of the ship’s sails which lay in store, and of\\nwhich I had a great stock by me.  Having fitted my mast and sail, and\\ntried the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made little\\nlockers or boxes at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries,\\nammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of\\nthe sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the inside of the\\nboat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to\\nkeep it dry.\\nI fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast, to stand\\nover my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and\\nthus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never\\nwent far out, nor far from the little creek.  At last, being eager to\\nview the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise;\\nand accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen\\nof loaves (cakes I should call them) of barley-bread, an earthen pot full\\nof parched rice (a food I ate a good deal of), a little bottle of rum,\\nhalf a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large\\nwatch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of\\nthe seamen’s chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to\\ncover me in the night.\\nIt was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign—or my\\ncaptivity, which you please—that I set out on this voyage, and I found it\\nmuch longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not very\\nlarge, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of\\nrocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some\\nunder it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more,\\nso that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.\\nWhen I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise, and\\ncome back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea;\\nand above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came to an\\nanchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken\\ngrappling which I got out of the ship.\\nHaving secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a\\nhill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent of\\nit, and resolved to venture.\\nIn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong,\\nand indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and even came\\nclose to the point; and I took the more notice of it because I saw there\\nmight be some danger that when I came into it I might be carried out to\\nsea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the island again; and\\nindeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe it would have been\\nso; for there was the same current on the other side the island, only\\nthat it set off at a further distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy\\nunder the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first\\ncurrent, and I should presently be in an eddy.\\nI lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at\\nESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach of\\nthe sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for me to keep too close\\nto the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the\\nstream.\\nThe third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the sea\\nwas calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and ignorant\\npilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my\\nboat’s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of\\nwater, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my boat along\\nwith it with such violence that all I could do could not keep her so much\\nas on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther and farther out\\nfrom the eddy, which was on my left hand.  There was no wind stirring to\\nhelp me, and all I could do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I\\nbegan to give myself over for lost; for as the current was on both sides\\nof the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they must join again, and\\nthen I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding\\nit; so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea,\\nfor that was calm enough, but of starving from hunger.  I had, indeed,\\nfound a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had\\ntossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to\\nsay, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being driven into\\nthe vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or\\nisland, for a thousand leagues at least?\\nAnd now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even the\\nmost miserable condition of mankind worse.  Now I looked back upon my\\ndesolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world and all\\nthe happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again.  I\\nstretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes—“O happy desert!” said I,\\n“I shall never see thee more.  O miserable creature! whither am going?”\\nThen I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had\\nrepined at my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be on\\nshore there again!  Thus, we never see the true state of our condition\\ntill it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value\\nwhat we enjoy, but by the want of it.  It is scarcely possible to imagine\\nthe consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for\\nso it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,\\nand in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.  However, I worked\\nhard till, indeed, my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as\\nmuch to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current which the\\neddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the\\nmeridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing\\nup from SSE.  This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in\\nabout half-an-hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale.  By this time I\\nhad got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy\\nor hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way, too; for I had\\nno compass on board, and should never have known how to have steered\\ntowards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather\\ncontinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my\\nsail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the\\ncurrent.\\nJust as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I\\nsaw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was\\nnear; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but\\nperceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I\\nfound to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some\\nrocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the\\nmain stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the\\nnorth-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a\\nstrong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp\\nstream.\\nThey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the\\nladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who\\nhave been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy\\nwas, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the\\nwind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running\\ncheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot.\\nThis eddy carried me about a league on my way back again, directly\\ntowards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the\\ncurrent which carried me away at first; so that when I came near the\\nisland, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,\\nthe other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.\\nWhen I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this\\ncurrent or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further.\\nHowever, I found that being between two great currents—viz. that on the\\nsouth side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay\\nabout a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake\\nof the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way; and\\nhaving still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly\\nfor the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.\\nAbout four o’clock in the evening, being then within a league of the\\nisland, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster\\nstretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting off\\nthe current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the\\nnorth; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my\\ncourse lay, which was due west, but almost full north.  However, having a\\nfresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west; and in\\nabout an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being\\nsmooth water, I soon got to land.\\nWhen I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks for my\\ndeliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my\\nboat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat\\nclose to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees,\\nand laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue\\nof the voyage.\\nI was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat!  I had run\\nso much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it\\nby the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the\\nwest side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I\\nresolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the shore, and\\nto see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety,\\nso as to have her again if I wanted her.  In about three miles or\\nthereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay,\\nabout a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet\\nor brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where\\nshe lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her.\\nHere I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to\\nlook about me, and see where I was.\\nI soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been\\nbefore, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of\\nmy boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my\\nmarch.  The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been\\nupon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found everything\\nstanding as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I\\nsaid before, my country house.\\nI got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs, for\\nI was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that read\\nmy story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my sleep\\nby a voice calling me by my name several times, “Robin, Robin, Robin\\nCrusoe: poor Robin Crusoe!  Where are you, Robin Crusoe?  Where are you?\\nWhere have you been?”\\nI was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or part of the\\nday, and with walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly;\\nbut dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice\\ncontinued to repeat, “Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,” at last I began to\\nwake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started\\nup in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but I\\nsaw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew that it\\nwas he that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language I had used\\nto talk to him and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly that he\\nwould sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face and cry,\\n“Poor Robin Crusoe!  Where are you?  Where have you been?  How came you\\nhere?” and such things as I had taught him.\\nHowever, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could\\nbe nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.\\nFirst, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he should\\njust keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well satisfied\\nit could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding out my\\nhand, and calling him by his name, “Poll,” the sociable creature came to\\nme, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me,\\n“Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and where had I been?” just\\nas if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home\\nalong with me.\\nI had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough to\\ndo for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been in.\\nI would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the\\nisland; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about.  As to the\\neast side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there\\nwas no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my very blood\\nrun chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, I\\ndid not know how it might be there; but supposing the current ran with\\nthe same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the\\nother, I might run the same risk of being driven down the stream, and\\ncarried by the island, as I had been before of being carried away from\\nit: so with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,\\nthough it had been the product of so many months’ labour to make it, and\\nof so many more to get it into the sea.\\nIn this government of my temper I remained near a year; and lived a very\\nsedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being very\\nmuch composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself\\nto the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily\\nin all things except that of society.\\nI improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my\\nnecessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should, upon\\noccasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how few\\ntools I had.\\nBesides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,\\nand contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found\\ninfinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shaped,\\nwhich before were filthy things indeed to look on.  But I think I was\\nnever more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I\\nfound out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it\\nwas a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red, like\\nother earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke,\\nI was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke;\\nand there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not\\nthinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I searched\\nthe ship again, I could not come at any pipes.\\nIn my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary\\nbaskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome, yet\\nthey were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things up in,\\nor fetching things home.  For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could\\nhang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring\\nit home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take\\nout the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me,\\nand bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.  Also,\\nlarge deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed\\nout as soon as it was dry and cured, and kept it in great baskets.\\nI began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want\\nwhich it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to\\nconsider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to\\nsay, how I should kill any goats.  I had, as is observed in the third\\nyear of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was\\nin hopes of getting a he-goat; but I could not by any means bring it to\\npass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in my heart\\nto kill her, she died at last of mere age.\\nBut being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,\\nmy ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and\\nsnare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and\\nparticularly I wanted a she-goat great with young.  For this purpose I\\nmade snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more than once\\ntaken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I\\nalways found them broken and my bait devoured.  At length I resolved to\\ntry a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where\\nI had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed\\nhurdles of my own making too, with a great weight upon them; and several\\ntimes I put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the trap; and I\\ncould easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn,\\nfor I could see the marks of their feet.  At length I set three traps in\\none night, and going the next morning I found them, all standing, and yet\\nthe bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.  However, I altered\\nmy traps; and not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to\\nsee my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-goat; and in one of\\nthe others three kids, a male and two females.\\nAs to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce I\\ndurst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away\\nalive, which was what I wanted.  I could have killed him, but that was\\nnot my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and\\nhe ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits.  But I did not\\nthen know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion.  If I\\nhad let him stay three or four days without food, and then have carried\\nhim some water to drink and then a little corn, he would have been as\\ntame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable\\ncreatures, where they are well used.\\nHowever, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:\\nthen I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them\\nwith strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.\\nIt was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some sweet\\ncorn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame.  And now I found that\\nif I expected to supply myself with goats’ flesh, when I had no powder or\\nshot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, I might\\nhave them about my house like a flock of sheep.  But then it occurred to\\nme that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always run\\nwild when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some\\nenclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep\\nthem in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those\\nwithout break in.\\nThis was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw there\\nwas an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a\\nproper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them to\\neat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.\\nThose who understand such enclosures will think I had very little\\ncontrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these (being\\na plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people call it in\\nthe western colonies), which had two or three little drills of fresh\\nwater in it, and at one end was very woody—I say, they will smile at my\\nforecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this piece of\\nground in such a manner that, my hedge or pale must have been at least\\ntwo miles about.  Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass,\\nfor if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it\\nin; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much\\ncompass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have so much\\nroom to chase them in that I should never catch them.\\nMy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when this\\nthought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the\\nbeginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty\\nyards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would\\nmaintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock\\nincreased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.\\nThis was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage.  I\\nwas about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done\\nit, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to\\nfeed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I\\nwould go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and\\nfeed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished and I\\nlet them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a\\nhandful of corn.\\nThis answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of\\nabout twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had\\nthree-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food.\\nAfter that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,\\nwith little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted, and gates out of\\none piece of ground into another.\\nBut this was not all; for now I not only had goat’s flesh to feed on when\\nI pleased, but milk too—a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I did\\nnot so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was\\nreally an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had\\nsometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day.  And as Nature, who gives\\nsupplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make\\nuse of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen\\nbutter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays\\nand miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also salt (though\\nI found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the\\nrocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards.  How mercifully can\\nour Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in which they\\nseemed to be overwhelmed in destruction!  How can He sweeten the\\nbitterest providences, and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and\\nprisons!  What a table was here spread for me in the wilderness, where I\\nsaw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!\\nCHAPTER XI—FINDS PRINT OF MAN’S FOOT ON THE SAND\\nIt would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit\\ndown to dinner.  There was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole\\nisland; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command; I\\ncould hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all\\nmy subjects.  Then, to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone,\\nattended by my servants!  Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the\\nonly person permitted to talk to me.  My dog, who was now grown old and\\ncrazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at\\nmy right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table and one on the\\nother, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of especial\\nfavour.\\nBut these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for\\nthey were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by\\nmy own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of\\ncreature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran\\nwild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they\\nwould often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was\\nobliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me.\\nWith this attendance and in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could\\nI be said to want anything but society; and of that, some time after\\nthis, I was likely to have too much.\\nI was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my\\nboat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes\\nI sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times I\\nsat myself down contented enough without her.  But I had a strange\\nuneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where, as I\\nhave said in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay,\\nand how the current set, that I might see what I had to do: this\\ninclination increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to\\ntravel thither by land, following the edge of the shore.  I did so; but\\nhad any one in England met such a man as I was, it must either have\\nfrightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently\\nstood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my\\ntravelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress.\\nBe pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows.\\nI had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat’s skin, with a flap\\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain\\noff from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates\\nas the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.\\nI had a short jacket of goat’s skin, the skirts coming down to about the\\nmiddle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the\\nbreeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down\\nsuch a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it reached to the\\nmiddle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair\\nof somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap\\nover my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a most\\nbarbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.\\nI had on a broad belt of goat’s skin dried, which I drew together with\\ntwo thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on\\neither side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and\\na hatchet, one on one side and one on the other.  I had another belt not\\nso broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder,\\nand at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of\\ngoat’s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot.\\nAt my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and over my\\nhead a great clumsy, ugly, goat’s-skin umbrella, but which, after all,\\nwas the most necessary thing I had about me next to my gun.  As for my\\nface, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might expect\\nfrom a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten\\ndegrees of the equinox.  My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was\\nabout a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors\\nsufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip,\\nwhich I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I\\nhad seen worn by some Turks at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such,\\nthough the Turks did; of these moustachios, or whiskers, I will not say\\nthey were long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length\\nand shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for\\nfrightful.\\nBut all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to observe\\nme that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of that.  In\\nthis kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or six days.\\nI travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I\\nfirst brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and having no\\nboat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the same\\nheight that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the points of the\\nrocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as\\nis said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet—no\\nrippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in other places.  I\\nwas at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some time\\nin the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had\\noccasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it was—viz. that the\\ntide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters\\nfrom some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current,\\nand that, according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from\\nthe north, this current came nearer or went farther from the shore; for,\\nwaiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then\\nthe tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as before,\\nonly that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the shore,\\nwhereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my\\ncanoe along with it, which at another time it would not have done.\\nThis observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the\\nebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat\\nabout the island again; but when I began to think of putting it in\\npractice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the\\ndanger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any\\npatience, but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was\\nmore safe, though more laborious—and this was, that I would build, or\\nrather make, me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side\\nof the island, and one for the other.\\nYou are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations\\nin the island—one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about\\nit, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had\\nenlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another.  One of\\nthese, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my\\nwall or fortification—that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the\\nrock—was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have given\\nan account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold\\nfive or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provisions,\\nespecially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the straw, and\\nthe other rubbed out with my hand.\\nAs for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles\\ngrew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so\\nvery much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one’s view, of\\nany habitation behind them.\\nNear this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and\\nupon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly\\ncultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its\\nseason; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land\\nadjoining as fit as that.\\nBesides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable plantation\\nthere also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I\\nkept in repair—that is to say, I kept the hedge which encircled it in\\nconstantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in\\nthe inside.  I kept the trees, which at first were no more than stakes,\\nbut were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so that they might\\nspread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which\\nthey did effectually to my mind.  In the middle of this I had my tent\\nalways standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set up for\\nthat purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and under\\nthis I had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the creatures I had\\nkilled, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on them, such as\\nbelonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved; and a great watch-coat to\\ncover me.  And here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief\\nseat, I took up my country habitation.\\nAdjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say my\\ngoats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and\\nenclose this ground.  I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the\\ngoats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite\\nlabour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and\\nso near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there\\nwas scarce room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,\\nwhen those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made\\nthe enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.\\nThis will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains\\nto bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support,\\nfor I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand\\nwould be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as\\nlong as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that\\nkeeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my\\nenclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of keeping them\\ntogether; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that\\nwhen these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick\\nthat I was forced to pull some of them up again.\\nIn this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended\\non for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve\\nvery carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet;\\nand indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome,\\nnourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.\\nAs this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the place\\nwhere I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way\\nthither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things\\nabout or belonging to her in very good order.  Sometimes I went out in\\nher to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely\\never above a stone’s cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of\\nbeing hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any\\nother accident.  But now I come to a new scene of my life.\\nIt happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly\\nsurprised with the print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was\\nvery plain to be seen on the sand.  I stood like one thunderstruck, or as\\nif I had seen an apparition.  I listened, I looked round me, but I could\\nhear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to look\\nfarther; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one; I\\ncould see no other impression but that one.  I went to it again to see if\\nthere were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but\\nthere was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a\\nfoot—toes, heel, and every part of a foot.  How it came thither I knew\\nnot, nor could I in the least imagine; but after innumerable fluttering\\nthoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to\\nmy fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but\\nterrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two or three\\nsteps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a\\ndistance to be a man.  Nor is it possible to describe how many various\\nshapes my affrighted imagination represented things to me in, how many\\nwild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what strange,\\nunaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.\\nWhen I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I\\nfled into it like one pursued.  Whether I went over by the ladder, as\\nfirst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a\\ndoor, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for\\nnever frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of\\nmind than I to this retreat.\\nI slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my\\nfright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary to\\nthe nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all\\ncreatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas\\nof the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself,\\neven though I was now a great way off.  Sometimes I fancied it must be\\nthe devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition, for how\\nshould any other thing in human shape come into the place?  Where was the\\nvessel that brought them?  What marks were there of any other footstep?\\nAnd how was it possible a man should come there?  But then, to think that\\nSatan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there could\\nbe no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot\\nbehind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I\\nshould see it—this was an amusement the other way.  I considered that the\\ndevil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me\\nthan this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the\\nother side of the island, he would never have been so simple as to leave\\na mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever\\nsee it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea,\\nupon a high wind, would have defaced entirely.  All this seemed\\ninconsistent with the thing itself and with all the notions we usually\\nentertain of the subtlety of the devil.\\nAbundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all\\napprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then that\\nit must be some more dangerous creature—viz. that it must be some of the\\nsavages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in their\\ncanoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made\\nthe island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea; being\\nas loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I would have\\nbeen to have had them.\\nWhile these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in\\nmy thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or\\nthat they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that\\nsome inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther\\nfor me.  Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having\\nfound out my boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I\\nshould certainly have them come again in greater numbers and devour me;\\nthat if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they would\\nfind my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of\\ntame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.\\nThus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence\\nin God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had of\\nHis goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not\\npreserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His\\ngoodness.  I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any\\nmore corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if\\nno accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon\\nthe ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the\\nfuture to have two or three years’ corn beforehand; so that, whatever\\nmight come, I might not perish for want of bread.\\nHow strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by what\\nsecret different springs are the affections hurried about, as different\\ncircumstances present!  To-day we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day we\\nseek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear,\\nnay, even tremble at the apprehensions of.  This was exemplified in me,\\nat this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only\\naffliction was that I seemed banished from human society, that I was\\nalone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and\\ncondemned to what I call silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven\\nthought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among\\nthe rest of His creatures; that to have seen one of my own species would\\nhave seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest\\nblessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,\\ncould bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions\\nof seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow\\nor silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island.\\nSuch is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many\\ncurious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first\\nsurprise.  I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely\\nwise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could\\nnot foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was\\nnot to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an\\nundoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as\\nHe thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had\\nlikewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought\\nfit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because I\\nhad sinned against Him.  I then reflected, that as God, who was not only\\nrighteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me,\\nso He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit to do so, it\\nwas my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to His\\nwill; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to\\nHim, and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of His daily\\nprovidence.\\nThese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and\\nmonths: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I\\ncannot omit.  One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with\\nthoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it\\ndiscomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came\\ninto my thoughts, “Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver\\nthee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”  Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my\\nbed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to\\npray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done praying I took up\\nmy Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me\\nwere, “Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen\\nthy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.”  It is impossible to express the\\ncomfort this gave me.  In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and\\nwas no more sad, at least on that occasion.\\nIn the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it\\ncame into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of my\\nown, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on\\nshore from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to\\npersuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my\\nown foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I\\nwas going that way to the boat?  Again, I considered also that I could by\\nno means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that\\nif, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played the\\npart of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions,\\nand then are frightened at them more than anybody.\\nNow I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not\\nstirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to\\nstarve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but some\\nbarley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked\\ntoo, which usually was my evening diversion: and the poor creatures were\\nin great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost\\nspoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.  Encouraging\\nmyself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print of\\none of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own\\nshadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country house to milk\\nmy flock: but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked\\nbehind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay down my basket and\\nrun for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted\\nwith an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly\\nfrightened; and so, indeed, I had.  However, I went down thus two or\\nthree days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and\\nto think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but I\\ncould not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the\\nshore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and\\nsee if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it\\nwas my own foot: but when I came to the place, first, it appeared\\nevidently to me, that when I laid up my boat I could not possibly be on\\nshore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when I came to measure the mark\\nwith my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal.  Both\\nthese things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the\\nvapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one\\nin an ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man\\nor men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was\\ninhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and what course\\nto take for my security I knew not.\\nOh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear!  It\\ndeprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their\\nrelief.  The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my\\nenclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the\\nenemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the\\nsame or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two\\ncorn-fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be\\nprompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent, that\\nthey might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look\\nfarther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.\\nThese were the subject of the first night’s cogitations after I was come\\nhome again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were\\nfresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours.  Thus, fear of danger is\\nten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to\\nthe eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the\\nevil which we are anxious about: and what was worse than all this, I had\\nnot that relief in this trouble that from the resignation I used to\\npractise I hoped to have.  I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained\\nnot only that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken\\nhim; for I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God\\nin my distress, and resting upon His providence, as I had done before,\\nfor my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been\\nmore cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried\\nthrough it with more resolution.\\nThis confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the morning\\nI fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as it were\\ntired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much\\nbetter composed than I had ever been before.  And now I began to think\\nsedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island\\n(which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the\\nmainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might\\nimagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the\\nspot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who,\\neither with design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross\\nwinds, might come to this place; that I had lived there fifteen years now\\nand had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and\\nthat, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable they\\nwent away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought\\nfit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I could suggest any\\ndanger from was from any casual accidental landing of straggling people\\nfrom the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were\\nhere against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again\\nwith all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest they\\nshould not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that,\\ntherefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in\\ncase I should see any savages land upon the spot.\\nNow, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring\\na door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my\\nfortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this,\\ntherefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the manner of\\na semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a\\ndouble row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention:\\nthese trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few\\npiles to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and stronger,\\nand my wall would be soon finished.  So that I had now a double wall; and\\nmy outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and\\neverything I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven little\\nholes, about as big as I might put my arm out at.  In the inside of this\\nI thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with continually bringing\\nearth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking\\nupon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of\\nwhich I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these\\nI planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them\\nlike a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes’\\ntime; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never\\nthought myself safe till it was done.\\nWhen this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great\\nlength every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,\\nwhich I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I\\nbelieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty\\nlarge space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an\\nenemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they\\nattempted to approach my outer wall.\\nThus in two years’ time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years’\\ntime I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and\\nstrong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what kind\\nsoever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a\\nhabitation.  As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out\\n(for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of\\nthe rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another\\nladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down no man living\\ncould come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had\\ncome down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.\\nThus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own\\npreservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether\\nwithout just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my\\nmere fear suggested to me.\\nCHAPTER XII—A CAVE RETREAT\\nWhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs;\\nfor I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were\\nnot only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be\\nsufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also\\nwithout the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to\\nlose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.\\nFor this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways\\nto preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave\\nunderground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to\\nenclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as\\nmuch concealed as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen young\\ngoats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in\\ngeneral, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and\\ntime: and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I\\nthought was the most rational design.\\nAccordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the\\nisland; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart\\ncould wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the\\nhollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once\\nbefore, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the\\nisland.  Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so\\nsurrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at\\nleast, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other\\npiece of ground I had worked so hard at.\\nI immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than a\\nmonth’s time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it\\nwhich you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be\\nsupposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further\\ndelay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and\\nwhen they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had made it\\nas secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it\\ntook me up more time by a great deal.  All this labour I was at the\\nexpense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a\\nman’s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near the\\nisland; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,\\nindeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be\\nwell imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of\\nthe fear of man.  And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the\\ndiscomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part\\nof my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of\\nsavages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself\\nin a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with the\\nsedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I rather\\nprayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded\\nwith danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and\\ndevoured before morning; and I must testify, from my experience, that a\\ntemper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more\\nproper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure: and that\\nunder the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a\\ncomforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for a\\nrepentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the\\nothers do the body; and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be\\nas great a disability as that of the body, and much greater; praying to\\nGod being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.\\nBut to go on.  After I had thus secured one part of my little living\\nstock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place\\nto make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of\\nthe island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I\\nsaw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance.  I had found a perspective\\nglass or two in one of the seamen’s chests, which I saved out of our\\nship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not\\ntell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able\\nto hold to look any longer; whether it was a boat or not I do not know,\\nbut as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it\\nover; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my\\npocket.  When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where,\\nindeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the\\nseeing the print of a man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the\\nisland as I imagined: and but that it was a special providence that I was\\ncast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should\\neasily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from\\nthe main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot\\nover to that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often met\\nand fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,\\nwould bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful\\ncustoms, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which\\nhereafter.\\nWhen I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the\\nSW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it\\npossible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore\\nspread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and\\nparticularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a\\ncircle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage\\nwretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their\\nfellow-creatures.\\nI was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no\\nnotions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my\\napprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,\\nhellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,\\nwhich, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of\\nbefore; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my\\nstomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature\\ndischarged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon\\nviolence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the\\nplace a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could,\\nand walked on towards my own habitation.\\nWhen I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still awhile,\\nas amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost\\naffection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God\\nthanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was\\ndistinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I\\nhad esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so\\nmany comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to\\ncomplain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable\\ncondition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of\\nHis blessing: which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to\\nall the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.\\nIn this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be\\nmuch easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was\\nbefore: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in\\nsearch of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not\\nexpecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered,\\nwoody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.  I knew I had\\nbeen here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of\\nhuman creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as\\nentirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them,\\nwhich I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to\\nkeep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort\\nof creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.  Yet I entertained\\nsuch an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of,\\nand of the wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one\\nanother up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my\\nown circle for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I\\nmean by it my three plantations—viz. my castle, my country seat (which I\\ncalled my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I look after\\nthis for any other use than an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion\\nwhich nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was as\\nfearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself.  I did not so much\\nas go to look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of\\nmaking another; for I could not think of ever making any more attempts to\\nbring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some\\nof these creatures at sea; in which case, if I had happened to have\\nfallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.\\nTime, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of\\nbeing discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about\\nthem; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before,\\nonly with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes\\nmore about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any\\nof them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any\\nof them, being on the island, should happen to hear it.  It was,\\ntherefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with\\na tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the\\nwoods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it\\nwas by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years\\nafter this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went\\nout without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of\\nthe ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them,\\nsticking them in my goat-skin belt.  I also furbished up one of the great\\ncutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on\\nalso; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went\\nabroad, if you add to the former description of myself the particular of\\ntwo pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a\\nscabbard.\\nThings going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting\\nthese cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way of living.\\nAll these things tended to show me more and more how far my condition was\\nfrom being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other\\nparticulars of life which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.\\nIt put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among\\nmankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their\\ncondition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be\\nalways comparing them with those which are better, to assist their\\nmurmurings and complainings.\\nAs in my present condition there were not really many things which I\\nwanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these\\nsavage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,\\nhad taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences; and I\\nhad dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and\\nthat was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then\\ntry to brew myself some beer.  This was really a whimsical thought, and I\\nreproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there\\nwould be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that\\nit would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it\\nin, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never\\ncompass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay months, in\\nattempting it, but to no purpose.  In the next place, I had no hops to\\nmake it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it\\nboil; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not\\nthe frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had\\nundertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave\\nanything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head to\\nbegan it.  But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and day\\nI could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of the monsters in\\ntheir cruel, bloody entertainment, and if possible save the victim they\\nshould bring hither to destroy.  It would take up a larger volume than\\nthis whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I\\nhatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these\\ncreatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming\\nhither any more: but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to\\ntake effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one\\nman do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them\\ntogether with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they\\ncould shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?\\nSometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they made\\ntheir fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when\\nthey kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all\\nthat was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to\\nwaste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of\\none barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain\\ntime, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little\\nmore than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not\\nsufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then\\nproposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place,\\nwith my three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody\\nceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps\\ntwo or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three\\npistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I\\nshould kill them all.  This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and\\nI was so full of it that I often dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I\\nwas just going to let fly at them in my sleep.  I went so far with it in\\nmy imagination that I employed myself several days to find out proper\\nplaces to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I\\nwent frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to\\nme; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a\\nbloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it,\\nthe horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous\\nwretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.  Well, at length I\\nfound a place in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might\\nsecurely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even\\nbefore they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into\\nsome thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough\\nto conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their\\nbloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so\\nclose together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss\\nmy shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first\\nshot.  In this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and\\naccordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece.  The\\ntwo muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller\\nbullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded\\nwith near a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my\\npistols with about four bullets each; and, in this posture, well provided\\nwith ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my\\nexpedition.\\nAfter I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put\\nit in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of\\nthe hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles or\\nmore, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the\\nisland, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard\\nduty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but\\ncame always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that\\ntime, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on\\nthe whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach every way.\\nAs long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also I\\nkept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the\\nwhile in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing\\ntwenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all\\nentered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my\\npassions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural\\ncustom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by\\nProvidence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide\\nthan that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and consequently\\nwere left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid\\nthings, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature,\\nentirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy,\\ncould have run them into.  But now, when, as I have said, I began to be\\nweary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far\\nevery morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter;\\nand I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was\\ngoing to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge\\nand executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit\\nfor so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on, and to be as it were the\\nexecutioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these people were\\noffenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of\\nthat blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another.  I debated\\nthis very often with myself thus: “How do I know what God Himself judges\\nin this particular case?  It is certain these people do not commit this\\nas a crime; it is not against their own consciences reproving, or their\\nlight reproaching them; they do not know it to be an offence, and then\\ncommit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins\\nwe commit.  They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war\\nthan we do to kill an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat\\nmutton.”\\nWhen I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was\\ncertainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the\\nsense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than\\nthose Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners\\ntaken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole\\ntroops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw\\ndown their arms and submitted.  In the next place, it occurred to me that\\nalthough the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman,\\nyet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that\\nif they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation,\\nto fall upon them, something might be said for it: but that I was yet out\\nof their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently\\nno design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon\\nthem; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their\\nbarbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these\\npeople; who, however they were idolators and barbarians, and had several\\nbloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human\\nbodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent\\npeople; and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with\\nthe utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves at\\nthis time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere\\nbutchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either\\nto God or man; and for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to\\nbe frightful and terrible, to all people of humanity or of Christian\\ncompassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the\\nproduce of a race of men who were without principles of tenderness, or\\nthe common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a\\nmark of generous temper in the mind.\\nThese considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full\\nstop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to\\nconclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the\\nsavages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they\\nfirst attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent:\\nbut that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty.  On\\nthe other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the way not to\\ndeliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was\\nsure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time, but\\nthat should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to\\ntell their country-people what had happened, they would come over again\\nby thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only\\nbring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had no\\nmanner of occasion for.  Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought,\\nneither in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to concern myself\\nin this affair: that my business was, by all possible means to conceal\\nmyself from them, and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by\\nthat there were any living creatures upon the island—I mean of human\\nshape.  Religion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was\\nconvinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was\\nlaying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures—I\\nmean innocent as to me.  As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one\\nanother, I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I ought\\nto leave them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and\\nknows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for\\nnational offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in\\na public manner, by such ways as best please Him.  This appeared so clear\\nto me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had\\nnot been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe\\nwould have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if I had\\ncommitted it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that He\\nhad thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me\\nthe protection of His providence, that I might not fall into the hands of\\nthe barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had\\na more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.\\nIn this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far\\nwas I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in\\nall that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were any\\nof them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore there\\nor not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances\\nagainst them, or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself\\nto fall upon them; only this I did: I went and removed my boat, which I\\nhad on the other side of the island, and carried it down to the east end\\nof the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found\\nunder some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the\\nsavages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon any\\naccount whatever.  With my boat I carried away everything that I had left\\nthere belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going\\nthither—viz. a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like\\nan anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or\\ngrapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these I\\nremoved, that there might not be the least shadow for discovery, or\\nappearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the island.\\nBesides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and\\nseldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment, to milk my\\nshe-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite\\non the other part of the island, was out of danger; for certain, it is\\nthat these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came\\nwith any thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently never\\nwandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been\\nseveral times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me\\ncautious, as well as before.  Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon\\nthe thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had chopped upon\\nthem and been discovered before that; when, naked and unarmed, except\\nwith one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot, I walked\\neverywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see what I could\\nget; what a surprise should I have been in if, when I discovered the\\nprint of a man’s foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty\\nsavages, and found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their\\nrunning no possibility of my escaping them!  The thoughts of this\\nsometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much\\nthat I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and\\nhow I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even should\\nnot have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much\\nless what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might be\\nable to do.  Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be\\nmelancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it\\nall at last into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me\\nfrom so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I\\ncould have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had\\nnot the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least\\nsupposition of its being possible.  This renewed a contemplation which\\noften had come into my thoughts in former times, when first I began to\\nsee the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in\\nthis life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it;\\nhow, when we are in a quandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation\\nwhether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this\\nway, when we intended to go that way: nay, when sense, our own\\ninclination, and perhaps business has called us to go the other way, yet\\na strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by\\nwe know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall\\nafterwards appear that had we gone that way, which we should have gone,\\nand even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been\\nruined and lost.  Upon these and many like reflections I afterwards made\\nit a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or\\npressings of mind to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going\\nthis way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I\\nknew no other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon\\nmy mind.  I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in\\nthe course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my\\ninhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it is very\\nlikely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes\\nthen that I see with now.  But it is never too late to be wise; and I\\ncannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with such\\nextraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not\\nto slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them come from what\\ninvisible intelligence they will.  That I shall not discuss, and perhaps\\ncannot account for; but certainly they are a proof of the converse of\\nspirits, and a secret communication between those embodied and those\\nunembodied, and such a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall\\nhave occasion to give some remarkable instances in the remainder of my\\nsolitary residence in this dismal place.\\nI believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess that\\nthese anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that\\nwas now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances\\nthat I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences.  I had the\\ncare of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food.  I cared\\nnot to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I\\nmight make should be heard: much less would I fire a gun for the same\\nreason: and above all I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest\\nthe smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray\\nme.  For this reason, I removed that part of my business which required\\nfire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in\\nthe woods; where, after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable\\nconsolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way,\\nand where, I daresay, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be\\nso hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who,\\nlike me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.\\nThe mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by\\nmere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe\\nall such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick\\nbranches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on I must observe the\\nreason of my making this charcoal, which was this—I was afraid of making\\na smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live\\nthere without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I contrived to\\nburn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it\\nbecame chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the\\ncoal to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was\\nwanting, without danger of smoke.  But this is by-the-bye.  While I was\\ncutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch\\nof low brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: I was\\ncurious to look in it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it,\\nI found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand\\nupright in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must confess to you\\nthat I made more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the\\nplace, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some\\ncreature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars;\\nthe dim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the\\nreflection.  However, after some pause I recovered myself, and began to\\ncall myself a thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see\\nthe devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and\\nthat I might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more\\nfrightful than myself.  Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a\\nfirebrand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I\\nhad not gone three steps in before I was almost as frightened as before;\\nfor I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was\\nfollowed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep\\nsigh again.  I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise\\nthat it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I\\nwill not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off.  But\\nstill plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a\\nlittle with considering that the power and presence of God was\\neverywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by\\nthe light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw\\nlying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his\\nwill, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old\\nage.  I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he\\nessayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with\\nmyself he might even lie there—for if he had frightened me, so he would\\ncertainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as\\nto come in there while he had any life in him.\\nI was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I\\nfound the cave was but very small—that is to say, it might be about\\ntwelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no\\nhands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.  I\\nobserved also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went\\nin further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and\\nknees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no\\ncandle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next\\nday provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock\\nof one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.\\nAccordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my\\nown making (for I made very good candles now of goat’s tallow, but was\\nhard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and\\nsometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this low\\nplace I was obliged to creep upon all-fours as I have said, almost ten\\nyards—which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering\\nthat I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.  When I had\\ngot through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near\\ntwenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I\\ndaresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or\\ncave—the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two\\ncandles.  What it was in the rock—whether diamonds or any other precious\\nstones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be—I knew not.  The place I\\nwas in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark;\\nthe floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon\\nit, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen,\\nneither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof.  The only\\ndifficulty in it was the entrance—which, however, as it was a place of\\nsecurity, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was a convenience; so\\nthat I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any\\ndelay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to\\nthis place: particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of\\npowder, and all my spare arms—viz. two fowling-pieces—for I had three in\\nall—and three muskets—for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my\\ncastle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my\\noutmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.  Upon\\nthis occasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the barrel of\\npowder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I\\nfound that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the\\npowder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the\\ninside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of\\nvery good powder in the centre of the cask.  This was a very agreeable\\ndiscovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never\\nkeeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for\\nfear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had\\nleft for bullets.\\nI fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live\\nin caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for I\\npersuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to\\nhunt me, they could never find me out—or if they did, they would not\\nventure to attack me here.  The old goat whom I found expiring died in\\nthe mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I\\nfound it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and\\ncover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to\\nprevent offence to my nose.\\nCHAPTER XIII—WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP\\nI was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and\\nwas so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I\\nbut have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to\\ndisturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending\\nthe rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me\\ndown and died, like the old goat in the cave.  I had also arrived to some\\nlittle diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal\\nmore pleasantly with me than it did before—first, I had taught my Poll,\\nas I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so\\narticulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived\\nwith me no less than six-and-twenty years.  How long he might have lived\\nafterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils\\nthat they live a hundred years.  My dog was a pleasant and loving\\ncompanion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died\\nof mere old age.  As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to\\nthat degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep\\nthem from devouring me and all I had; but at length, when the two old\\nones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually driving\\nthem from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran\\nwild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame,\\nand whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were part\\nof my family.  Besides these I always kept two or three household kids\\nabout me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more\\nparrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call “Robin Crusoe,” but\\nnone like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them\\nthat I had done with him.  I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name\\nI knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the\\nlittle stakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown\\nup to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees,\\nand bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above,\\nI began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have\\nbeen secured from the dread of the savages.  But it was otherwise\\ndirected; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my\\nstory to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the\\ncourse of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and\\nwhich, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes\\nthe very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be\\nraised again from the affliction we are fallen into.  I could give many\\nexamples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing\\nwas it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last\\nyears of solitary residence in this island.\\nIt was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third\\nyear; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call\\nit), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty\\nmuch abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning, even\\nbefore it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of\\nsome fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,\\ntoward that part of the island where I had observed some savages had\\nbeen, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great affliction,\\nit was on my side of the island.\\nI was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my\\ngrove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no\\nmore peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in\\nrambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of\\nmy works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were\\npeople in the place, and would then never rest till they had found me\\nout.  In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the\\nladder after me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as\\nI could.\\nThen I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.  I\\nloaded all my cannon, as I called them—that is to say, my muskets, which\\nwere mounted upon my new fortification—and all my pistols, and resolved\\nto defend myself to the last gasp—not forgetting seriously to commend\\nmyself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver\\nme out of the hands of the barbarians.  I continued in this posture about\\ntwo hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had\\nno spies to send out.  After sitting a while longer, and musing what I\\nshould do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance\\nlonger; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was\\na flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder after me,\\nI set it up again and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my\\nperspective glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on\\nmy belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.  I presently\\nfound there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small\\nfire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the\\nweather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their\\nbarbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether\\nalive or dead I could not tell.\\nThey had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore;\\nand as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the return\\nof the flood to go away again.  It is not easy to imagine what confusion\\nthis sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of the\\nisland, and so near to me; but when I considered their coming must be\\nalways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate\\nin my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the\\ntime of the flood of tide, if they were not on shore before; and having\\nmade this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the more\\ncomposure.\\nAs I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the westward\\nI saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it) away.  I\\nshould have observed, that for an hour or more before they went off they\\nwere dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by\\nmy glass.  I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they\\nwere stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether\\nthey were men or women I could not distinguish.\\nAs soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my\\nshoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side\\nwithout a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away\\nto the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as\\nsoon as I got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could\\nnot go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there\\nhad been three canoes more of the savages at that place; and looking out\\nfarther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main.\\nThis was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore,\\nI could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about\\nhad left behind it—viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of\\nhuman bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and\\nsport.  I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began\\nto premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be\\nwhom or how many soever.  It seemed evident to me that the visits which\\nthey made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above\\nfifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again—that is\\nto say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all\\nthat time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come\\nabroad, at least not so far.  Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,\\nby reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by\\nsurprise: from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more\\nbitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off\\nthat expectation or those apprehensions.\\nDuring all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my\\nhours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to\\ncircumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see\\nthem—especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,\\ninto two parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one\\nparty—suppose ten or a dozen—I was still the next day, or week, or month,\\nto kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I should be,\\nat length, no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters—and\\nperhaps much more so.  I spent my days now in great perplexity and\\nanxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall into the\\nhands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture\\nabroad, it was not without looking around me with the greatest care and\\ncaution imaginable.  And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it\\nwas that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats, for I durst not\\nupon any account fire my gun, especially near that side of the island\\nwhere they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had\\nfled from me now, I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or\\nthree hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what to\\nexpect.  However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever\\nsaw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon\\nobserve.  It is true they might have been there once or twice; but either\\nthey made no stay, or at least I did not see them; but in the month of\\nMay, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I\\nhad a very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.\\nThe perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months’\\ninterval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful\\ndreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night.  In the day great\\ntroubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed often of killing\\nthe savages and of the reasons why I might justify doing it.\\nBut to waive all this for a while.  It was in the middle of May, on the\\nsixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon,\\nfor I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of\\nMay that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of\\nlightning and thunder, and; a very foul night it was after it.  I knew\\nnot what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was reading in the\\nBible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present\\ncondition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired\\nat sea.  This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature\\nfrom any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts\\nwere quite of another kind.  I started up in the greatest haste\\nimaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the\\nrock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the\\ntop of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a\\nsecond gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I heard; and by\\nthe sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven\\ndown the current in my boat.  I immediately considered that this must be\\nsome ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship\\nin company, and fired these for signals of distress, and to obtain help.\\nI had the presence of mind at that minute to think, that though I could\\nnot help them, it might be that they might help me; so I brought together\\nall the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I\\nset it on fire upon the hill.  The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and,\\nthough the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was\\ncertain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it.\\nAnd no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard\\nanother gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter.  I\\nplied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day,\\nand the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full\\neast of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish—no,\\nnot with my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still\\nsomething hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.\\nI looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did\\nnot move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and\\nbeing eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand,\\nand ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I had\\nformerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there, the\\nweather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my\\ngreat sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those\\nconcealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks,\\nas they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of\\ncounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most\\ndesperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life.\\nThus, what is one man’s safety is another man’s destruction; for it seems\\nthese men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks\\nbeing wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the night, the\\nwind blowing hard at ENE.  Had they seen the island, as I must\\nnecessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have\\nendeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;\\nbut their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I\\nimagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.  First, I imagined that\\nupon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their boat, and\\nendeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very high, they\\nmight have been cast away.  Other times I imagined that they might have\\nlost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; particularly by\\nthe breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to\\nstave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard\\nwith their own hands.  Other times I imagined they had some other ship or\\nships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they made, had taken\\nthem up, and carried them off.  Other times I fancied they were all gone\\noff to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I\\nhad been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there\\nwas nothing but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by\\nthis time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one\\nanother.\\nAs all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in,\\nI could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity\\nthem; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it gave me more\\nand more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably\\nprovided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships’\\ncompanies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one\\nlife should be spared but mine.  I learned here again to observe, that it\\nis very rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition so\\nlow, or any misery so great, but we may see something or other to be\\nthankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.\\nSuch certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as\\nsee room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make it rational so\\nmuch as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the\\npossibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company; and\\nthis was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or\\nappearance of any such thing.  I cannot explain, by any possible energy\\nof words, what a strange longing I felt in my soul upon this sight,\\nbreaking out sometimes thus: “Oh that there had been but one or two, nay,\\nor but one soul saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I\\nmight but have had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to\\nme and to have conversed with!”  In all the time of my solitary life I\\nnever felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my\\nfellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.\\nThere are some secret springs in the affections which, when they are set\\na-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered\\npresent to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out\\nthe soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings of the\\nobject, that the absence of it is insupportable.  Such were these earnest\\nwishings that but one man had been saved.  I believe I repeated the\\nwords, “Oh that it had been but one!” a thousand times; and my desires\\nwere so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch\\ntogether, and my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I\\nhad had any soft thing in my hand I should have crushed it involuntarily;\\nand the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against one\\nanother so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.  Let\\nthe naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of them.\\nAll I can do is to describe the fact, which was even surprising to me\\nwhen I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded; it was\\ndoubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my\\nmind, realising the comfort which the conversation of one of my\\nfellow-Christians would have been to me.  But it was not to be; either\\ntheir fate or mine, or both, forbade it; for, till the last year of my\\nbeing on this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that\\nship or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the\\ncorpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was\\nnext the shipwreck.  He had no clothes on but a seaman’s waistcoat, a\\npair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to\\ndirect me so much as to guess what nation he was of.  He had nothing in\\nhis pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe—the last was to me\\nof ten times more value than the first.\\nIt was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this\\nwreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be\\nuseful to me.  But that did not altogether press me so much as the\\npossibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose\\nlife I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my\\nown to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart that I\\ncould not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on\\nboard this wreck; and committing the rest to God’s providence, I thought\\nthe impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be\\nresisted—that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I\\nshould be wanting to myself if I did not go.\\nUnder the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,\\nprepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot\\nof fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a\\ngreat deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus, loading\\nmyself with everything necessary.  I went down to my boat, got the water\\nout of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went\\nhome again for more.  My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the\\numbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot of water,\\nand about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before,\\nwith a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese; all which with great labour\\nand sweat I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I\\nput out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last\\nto the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.  And now I was\\nto launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture.  I\\nlooked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the\\nisland at a distance, and which were very terrible to me from the\\nremembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to\\nfail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those\\ncurrents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of\\nmy reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but\\nsmall, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably\\nlost.\\nThese thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my\\nenterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I\\nstepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and\\nanxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing,\\nI could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; upon\\nwhich my going was impracticable for so many hours.  Upon this, presently\\nit occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I\\ncould find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents\\nlay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven\\none way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the\\nsame rapidity of the currents.  This thought was no sooner in my head\\nthan I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the\\nsea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the currents or sets\\nof the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return.  Here I\\nfound, that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the\\nisland, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the\\nnorth side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north side of\\nthe island in my return, and I should do well enough.\\nEncouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to set out\\nwith the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my\\ncanoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out.  I first made a\\nlittle out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the\\ncurrent, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and\\nyet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before,\\nso as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a strong\\nsteerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck,\\nand in less than two hours I came up to it.  It was a dismal sight to\\nlook at; the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed\\nin between two rocks.  All the stern and quarter of her were beaten to\\npieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had\\nrun on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the\\nboard—that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and\\nthe head and bow appeared firm.  When I came close to her, a dog appeared\\nupon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I\\ncalled him, jumped into the sea to come to me.  I took him into the boat,\\nbut found him almost dead with hunger and thirst.  I gave him a cake of\\nmy bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving\\na fortnight in the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water,\\nwith which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.  After\\nthis I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men drowned\\nin the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about\\none another.  I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship\\nstruck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually\\nover her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with\\nthe constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under\\nwater.  Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had\\nlife; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the\\nwater.  There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew\\nnot, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I\\ncould see; but they were too big to meddle with.  I saw several chests,\\nwhich I believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them\\ninto the boat, without examining what was in them.  Had the stern of the\\nship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have\\nmade a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room to\\nsuppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess\\nfrom the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres,\\nor the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils\\nto the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.  She\\nhad, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to\\nanybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.\\nI found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about\\ntwenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty.  There\\nwere several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about\\nfour pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for\\nthem, so I left them, but took the powder-horn.  I took a fire-shovel and\\ntongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles, a\\ncopper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo, and\\nthe dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again—and the same\\nevening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again, weary\\nand fatigued to the last degree.  I reposed that night in the boat and in\\nthe morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave, and not\\ncarry it home to my castle.  After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo\\non shore, and began to examine the particulars.  The cask of liquor I\\nfound to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils; and, in\\na word, not at all good; but when I came to open the chests, I found\\nseveral things of great use to me—for example, I found in one a fine case\\nof bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters,\\nfine and very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were\\ntipped with silver.  I found two pots of very good succades, or\\nsweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the salt-water had not hurt\\nthem; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.  I found\\nsome very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen\\nand a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the\\nformer were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my\\nface in a hot day.  Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I\\nfound there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven\\nhundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six\\ndoubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they\\nmight all weigh near a pound.  In the other chest were some clothes, but\\nof little value; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the\\ngunner’s mate; though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of\\nfine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their\\nfowling-pieces on occasion.  Upon the whole, I got very little by this\\nvoyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner\\nof occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would\\nhave given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,\\nwhich were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my feet for many\\nyears.  I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the\\nfeet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair\\nmore in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were\\nnot like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what\\nwe call pumps than shoes.  I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty\\npieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I supposed this belonged to a\\npoorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer.  Well,\\nhowever, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had\\ndone that before which I had brought from our own ship; but it was a\\ngreat pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to\\nmy share: for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times\\nover with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might\\nlie here safe enough till I come again and fetch it.\\nCHAPTER XIV—A DREAM REALISED\\nHaving now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back\\nto my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,\\nwhere I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habitation,\\nwhere I found everything safe and quiet.  I began now to repose myself,\\nlive after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a\\nwhile I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to\\nbe, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time\\nI did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the\\nisland, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and\\nwhere I could go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms and\\nammunition as I always carried with me if I went the other way.\\nI lived in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head, that\\nwas always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all\\nthese two years filled with projects and designs how, if it were\\npossible, I might get away from this island: for sometimes I was for\\nmaking another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there\\nwas nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a\\nramble one way, sometimes another—and I believe verily, if I had had the\\nboat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound\\nanywhere, I knew not whither.\\nI have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are touched\\nwith the general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half\\nof their miseries flow: I mean that of not being satisfied with the\\nstation wherein God and Nature hath placed them—for, not to look back\\nupon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father, the\\nopposition to which was, as I may call it, my _original sin_, my\\nsubsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming\\ninto this miserable condition; for had that Providence which so happily\\nseated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with confined desires,\\nand I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have\\nbeen by this time—I mean in the time of my being in this island—one of\\nthe most considerable planters in the Brazils—nay, I am persuaded, that\\nby the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and\\nthe increase I should probably have made if I had remained, I might have\\nbeen worth a hundred thousand moidores—and what business had I to leave\\na settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and increasing,\\nto turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when patience and time\\nwould have so increased our stock at home, that we could have bought\\nthem at our own door from those whose business it was to fetch them? and\\nthough it had cost us something more, yet the difference of that price\\nwas by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.  But as this is\\nusually the fate of young heads, so reflection upon the folly of it is\\nas commonly the exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience\\nof time—so it was with me now; and yet so deep had the mistake taken\\nroot in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but\\nwas continually poring upon the means and possibility of my escape from\\nthis place; and that I may, with greater pleasure to the reader, bring\\non the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper to give some\\naccount of my first conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme\\nfor my escape, and how, and upon what foundation, I acted.\\nI am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to\\nthe wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my\\ncondition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than\\nI had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it\\nthan the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.\\nIt was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the\\nfour-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of\\nsolitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health,\\nhad no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of\\nmind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so\\nas to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows:\\nIt is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled\\nthrough that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night’s\\ntime.  I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by\\nabridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of\\nthat part of my life since I came to this island.  In my reflections upon\\nthe state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was\\ncomparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my\\nhabitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I had\\nlived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand.  Not that\\nI did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the\\nwhile, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore\\nthere; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions\\nabout it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same, and\\nI was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had never really been\\nexposed to it.  This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable\\nreflections, and particularly this one: How infinitely good that\\nProvidence is, which has provided, in its government of mankind, such\\nnarrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks\\nin the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if\\ndiscovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is\\nkept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes,\\nand knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.\\nAfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect\\nseriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this\\nvery island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and\\nwith all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of\\na hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between\\nme and the worst kind of destruction—viz. that of falling into the hands\\nof cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view\\nas I would on a goat or turtle; and have thought it no more crime to kill\\nand devour me than I did of a pigeon or a curlew.  I would unjustly\\nslander myself if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great\\nPreserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with great\\nhumanity, all these unknown deliverances were due, and without which I\\nmust inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands.\\nWhen these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in\\nconsidering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages,\\nand how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all things\\nshould give up any of His creatures to such inhumanity—nay, to something\\nso much below even brutality itself—as to devour its own kind: but as\\nthis ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred to\\nme to inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in? how far off\\nthe coast was from whence they came? what they ventured over so far from\\nhome for? what kind of boats they had? and why I might not order myself\\nand my business so that I might be able to go over thither, as they were\\nto come to me?\\nI never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with\\nmyself when I went thither; what would become of me if I fell into the\\nhands of these savages; or how I should escape them if they attacked me;\\nno, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not\\nto be attacked by some or other of them, without any possibility of\\ndelivering myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, what I\\nshould do for provision, or whither I should bend my course; none of\\nthese thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my mind was wholly\\nbent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the mainland.  I\\nlooked upon my present condition as the most miserable that could\\npossibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into anything but death,\\nthat could be called worse; and if I reached the shore of the main I\\nmight perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the\\nAfrican shore, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I might\\nfind some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall in with some\\nChristian ship that might take me in: and if the worst came to the worst,\\nI could but die, which would put an end to all these miseries at once.\\nPray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient\\ntemper, made desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of my\\ntroubles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on\\nboard of, and where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly\\nlonged for—somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from them of\\nthe place where I was, and of the probable means of my deliverance.  I\\nwas agitated wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of mind, in my\\nresignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of\\nHeaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had as it were no power to turn my\\nthoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which\\ncame upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it\\nwas not to be resisted.\\nWhen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such\\nviolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as\\nif I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my\\nmind about it, Nature—as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the\\nvery thoughts of it—threw me into a sound sleep.  One would have thought\\nI should have dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to\\nit, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning as usual from my\\ncastle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to\\nland, and that they brought with them another savage whom they were going\\nto kill in order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were\\ngoing to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I thought in my\\nsleep that he came running into my little thick grove before my\\nfortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not\\nperceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and\\nsmiling upon him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to me, seeming to\\npray me to assist him; upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up,\\nand carried him into my cave, and he became my servant; and that as soon\\nas I had got this man, I said to myself, “Now I may certainly venture to\\nthe mainland, for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will tell me\\nwhat to do, and whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go for\\nfear of being devoured; what places to venture into, and what to shun.”\\nI waked with this thought; and was under such inexpressible impressions\\nof joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments\\nwhich I felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it was no more than\\na dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very\\ngreat dejection of spirits.\\nUpon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my only way to go about\\nto attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my\\npossession: and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, whom\\nthey had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill.  But\\nthese thoughts still were attended with this difficulty: that it was\\nimpossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and\\nkilling them all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and\\nmight miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the\\nlawfulness of it to myself; and my heart trembled at the thoughts of\\nshedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance.  I need not\\nrepeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the\\nsame mentioned before; but though I had other reasons to offer now—viz.\\nthat those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they\\ncould; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver\\nmyself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as\\nmuch as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say though\\nthese things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for\\nmy deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means\\nreconcile myself to for a great while.  However, at last, after many\\nsecret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for\\nall these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long\\ntime), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all\\nthe rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into\\nmy hands, cost what it would.  My next thing was to contrive how to do\\nit, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could\\npitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the\\nwatch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the\\nevent; taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let what\\nwould be.\\nWith these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as\\noften as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it;\\nfor it was above a year and a half that I waited; and for great part of\\nthat time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the\\nisland almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared.  This was\\nvery discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that\\nit did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off the edge\\nof my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the\\nmore eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful to shun\\nthe sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was now\\neager to be upon them.  Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,\\nnay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely\\nslaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their\\nbeing able at any time to do me any hurt.  It was a great while that I\\npleased myself with this affair; but nothing still presented itself; all\\nmy fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near me for a\\ngreat while.\\nAbout a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long\\nmusing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an\\noccasion to put them into execution), I was surprised one morning by\\nseeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the\\nisland, and the people who belonged to them all landed and out of my\\nsight.  The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and\\nknowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I\\ncould not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to attack\\ntwenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, perplexed\\nand discomforted.  However, I put myself into the same position for an\\nattack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for action, if\\nanything had presented.  Having waited a good while, listening to hear if\\nthey made any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns at\\nthe foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill, by my two\\nstages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear above\\nthe hill, so that they could not perceive me by any means.  Here I\\nobserved, by the help of my perspective glass, that they were no less\\nthan thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that they had\\nmeat dressed.  How they had cooked it I knew not, or what it was; but\\nthey were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and\\nfigures, their own way, round the fire.\\nWhile I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two\\nmiserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were\\nlaid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter.  I perceived one of\\nthem immediately fall; being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or\\nwooden sword, for that was their way; and two or three others were at\\nwork immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other\\nvictim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.\\nIn that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty\\nand unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away\\nfrom them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, directly\\ntowards me; I mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation\\nwas.  I was dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I perceived\\nhim run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by\\nthe whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream was coming to\\npass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could\\nnot depend, by any means, upon my dream, that the other savages would not\\npursue him thither and find him there.  However, I kept my station, and\\nmy spirits began to recover when I found that there was not above three\\nmen that followed him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found that\\nhe outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained ground on them; so\\nthat, if he could but hold out for half-an-hour, I saw easily he would\\nfairly get away from them all.\\nThere was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned often\\nin the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship;\\nand this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch\\nwould be taken there; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made\\nnothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through\\nin about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding\\nstrength and swiftness.  When the three persons came to the creek, I\\nfound that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and that,\\nstanding on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther,\\nand soon after went softly back again; which, as it happened, was very\\nwell for him in the end.  I observed that the two who swam were yet more\\nthan twice as strong swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled\\nfrom them.  It came very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed\\nirresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and, perhaps, a\\ncompanion or assistant; and that I was plainly called by Providence to\\nsave this poor creature’s life.  I immediately ran down the ladders with\\nall possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both at the\\nfoot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting up again with the\\nsame haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having\\na very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way between the\\npursuers and the pursued, hallowing aloud to him that fled, who, looking\\nback, was at first perhaps as much frightened at me as at them; but I\\nbeckoned with my hand to him to come back; and, in the meantime, I slowly\\nadvanced towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the\\nforemost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece.  I was loath to\\nfire, because I would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance,\\nit would not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke,\\ntoo, they would not have known what to make of it.  Having knocked this\\nfellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if he had been\\nfrightened, and I advanced towards him: but as I came nearer, I perceived\\npresently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me: so I\\nwas then obliged to shoot at him first, which I did, and killed him at\\nthe first shot.  The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he saw\\nboth his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so frightened\\nwith the fire and noise of my piece that he stood stock still, and\\nneither came forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather inclined\\nstill to fly than to come on.  I hallooed again to him, and made signs to\\ncome forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way; then\\nstopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; and I could\\nthen perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,\\nand had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were.  I beckoned to\\nhim again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that\\nI could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten\\nor twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life.  I\\nsmiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still\\nnearer; at length he came close to me; and then he kneeled down again,\\nkissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by\\nthe foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of\\nswearing to be my slave for ever.  I took him up and made much of him,\\nand encouraged him all I could.  But there was more work to do yet; for I\\nperceived the savage whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned\\nwith the blow, and began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and\\nshowed him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some\\nwords to me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they\\nwere pleasant to hear; for they were the first sound of a man’s voice\\nthat I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years.  But\\nthere was no time for such reflections now; the savage who was knocked\\ndown recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I\\nperceived that my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I\\npresented my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this\\nmy savage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my\\nsword, which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.  He no sooner\\nhad it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so\\ncleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better;\\nwhich I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never\\nsaw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however,\\nit seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so\\nsharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut off\\nheads with them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow, too.  When he had\\ndone this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the\\nsword again, and with abundance of gestures which I did not understand,\\nlaid it down, with the head of the savage that he had killed, just before\\nme.  But that which astonished him most was to know how I killed the\\nother Indian so far off; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me to let\\nhim go to him; and I bade him go, as well as I could.  When he came to\\nhim, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one\\nside, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet had made, which\\nit seems was just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great\\nquantity of blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was\\nquite dead.  He took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to\\ngo away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that more\\nmight come after them.  Upon this he made signs to me that he should bury\\nthem with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they\\nfollowed; and so I made signs to him again to do so.  He fell to work;\\nand in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands big\\nenough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered\\nhim; and did so by the other also; I believe he had him buried them both\\nin a quarter of an hour.  Then, calling away, I carried him, not to my\\ncastle, but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the island: so\\nI did not let my dream come to pass in that part, that he came into my\\ngrove for shelter.  Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat,\\nand a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress\\nfor, from his running: and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to\\ngo and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where I had laid some\\nrice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself\\nsometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.\\nHe was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight,\\nstrong limbs, not too large; tall, and well-shaped; and, as I reckon,\\nabout twenty-six years of age.  He had a very good countenance, not a\\nfierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his\\nface; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a European in his\\ncountenance, too, especially when he smiled.  His hair was long and\\nblack, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a\\ngreat vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes.  The colour of his\\nskin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow,\\nnauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of\\nAmerica are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had in it\\nsomething very agreeable, though not very easy to describe.  His face was\\nround and plump; his nose small, not flat, like the negroes; a very good\\nmouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory.\\nAfter he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half-an-hour, he awoke\\nagain, and came out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats\\nwhich I had in the enclosure just by: when he espied me he came running\\nto me, laying himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible\\nsigns of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many antic\\ngestures to show it.  At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,\\nclose to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done\\nbefore; and after this made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude,\\nand submission imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so long\\nas he lived.  I understood him in many things, and let him know I was\\nvery well pleased with him.  In a little time I began to speak to him;\\nand teach him to speak to me; and first, I let him know his name should\\nbe Friday, which was the day I saved his life; I called him so for the\\nmemory of the time.  I likewise taught him to say Master; and then let\\nhim know that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No\\nand to know the meaning of them.  I gave him some milk in an earthen pot,\\nand let him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it; and gave\\nhim a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with, and\\nmade signs that it was very good for him.  I kept there with him all that\\nnight; but as soon as it was day I beckoned to him to come with me, and\\nlet him know I would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad,\\nfor he was stark naked.  As we went by the place where he had buried the\\ntwo men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he\\nhad made to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them\\nup again and eat them.  At this I appeared very angry, expressed my\\nabhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and\\nbeckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately, with\\ngreat submission.  I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if\\nhis enemies were gone; and pulling out my glass I looked, and saw plainly\\nthe place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their canoes;\\nso that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades\\nbehind them, without any search after them.\\nBut I was not content with this discovery; but having now more courage,\\nand consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him\\nthe sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found\\nhe could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two\\nfor myself; and away we marched to the place where these creatures had\\nbeen; for I had a mind now to get some further intelligence of them.\\nWhen I came to the place my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my\\nheart sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a\\ndreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of\\nit.  The place was covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their\\nblood, and great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten,\\nmangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant\\nfeast they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.  I\\nsaw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and\\nfeet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his\\nsigns, made me understand that they brought over four prisoners to feast\\nupon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself,\\nwas the fourth; that there had been a great battle between them and their\\nnext king, of whose subjects, it seems, he had been one, and that they\\nhad taken a great number of prisoners; all which were carried to several\\nplaces by those who had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon\\nthem, as was done here by these wretches upon those they brought hither.\\nI caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever\\nremained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon it,\\nand burn them all to ashes.  I found Friday had still a hankering stomach\\nafter some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I\\nshowed so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least\\nappearance of it, that he durst not discover it: for I had, by some\\nmeans, let him know that I would kill him if he offered it.\\nWhen he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to\\nwork for my man Friday; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen\\ndrawers, which I had out of the poor gunner’s chest I mentioned, which I\\nfound in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very\\nwell; and then I made him a jerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my skill\\nwould allow (for I was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I gave him\\na cap which I made of hare’s skin, very convenient, and fashionable\\nenough; and thus he was clothed, for the present, tolerably well, and was\\nmighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.\\nIt is true he went awkwardly in these clothes at first: wearing the\\ndrawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled\\nhis shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them where\\nhe complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took to them\\nat length very well.\\nThe next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to consider\\nwhere I should lodge him: and that I might do well for him and yet be\\nperfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place\\nbetween my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the\\noutside of the first.  As there was a door or entrance there into my\\ncave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it, of boards, and\\nset it up in the passage, a little within the entrance; and, causing the\\ndoor to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my\\nladders, too; so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my\\ninnermost wall, without making so much noise in getting over that it must\\nneeds awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of\\nlong poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill;\\nwhich was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of laths, and\\nthen thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which was\\nstrong, like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in or\\nout by the ladder I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been\\nattempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have\\nfallen down and made a great noise—as to weapons, I took them all into my\\nside every night.  But I needed none of all this precaution; for never\\nman had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me:\\nwithout passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged;\\nhis very affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a father;\\nand I daresay he would have sacrificed his life to save mine upon any\\noccasion whatsoever—the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of\\ndoubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions for my\\nsafety on his account.\\nThis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that\\nhowever it had pleased God in His providence, and in the government of\\nthe works of His hands, to take from so great a part of the world of His\\ncreatures the best uses to which their faculties and the powers of their\\nsouls are adapted, yet that He has bestowed upon them the same powers,\\nthe same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and\\nobligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same sense\\nof gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good\\nand receiving good that He has given to us; and that when He pleases to\\noffer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more\\nready, to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed than\\nwe are.  This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the\\nseveral occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even\\nthough we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,\\nthe Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His word added to our\\nunderstanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving\\nknowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this\\npoor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.  From hence\\nI sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence,\\nand, as it were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of\\nthings, that should hide that sight from some, and reveal it to others,\\nand yet expect a like duty from both; but I shut it up, and checked my\\nthoughts with this conclusion: first, that we did not know by what light\\nand law these should be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and\\nby the nature of His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be,\\nbut if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was\\non account of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says,\\nwas a law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would\\nacknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us;\\nand secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the\\npotter, no vessel could say to him, “Why hast thou formed me thus?”\\nBut to return to my new companion.  I was greatly delighted with him, and\\nmade it my business to teach him everything that was proper to make him\\nuseful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and\\nunderstand me when I spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever was;\\nand particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased\\nwhen he could but understand me, or make me understand him, that it was\\nvery pleasant for me to talk to him.  Now my life began to be so easy\\nthat I began to say to myself that could I but have been safe from more\\nsavages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place where I\\nlived.\\nCHAPTER XV—FRIDAY’S EDUCATION\\nAfter I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought that,\\nin order to bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the\\nrelish of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so\\nI took him out with me one morning to the woods.  I went, indeed,\\nintending to kill a kid out of my own flock; and bring it home and dress\\nit; but as I was going I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two\\nyoung kids sitting by her.  I catched hold of Friday.  “Hold,” said I,\\n“stand still;” and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I presented\\nmy piece, shot, and killed one of the kids.  The poor creature, who had\\nat a distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not\\nknow, nor could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,\\ntrembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I thought he would have\\nsunk down.  He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed\\nit, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he was not wounded; and,\\nas I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him: for he came and\\nkneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things I\\ndid not understand; but I could easily see the meaning was to pray me not\\nto kill him.\\nI soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and\\ntaking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which\\nI had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did: and\\nwhile he was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I\\nloaded my gun again.  By-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting\\nupon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I\\nwould do, I called him to me again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed\\na parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to the\\nparrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see\\nI would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill\\nthat bird; accordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he\\nsaw the parrot fall.  He stood like one frightened again, notwithstanding\\nall I had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did\\nnot see me put anything into the gun, but thought that there must be some\\nwonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man,\\nbeast, bird, or anything near or far off; and the astonishment this\\ncreated in him was such as could not wear off for a long time; and I\\nbelieve, if I would have let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun.\\nAs for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days\\nafter; but he would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered\\nhim, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was\\nto desire it not to kill him.  Well, after his astonishment was a little\\nover at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot,\\nwhich he did, but stayed some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead,\\nhad fluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell:\\nhowever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and as I had\\nperceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advantage to\\ncharge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, that I might be\\nready for any other mark that might present; but nothing more offered at\\nthat time: so I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the\\nskin off, and cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for\\nthat purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very\\ngood broth.  After I had begun to eat some I gave some to my man, who\\nseemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was\\nstrangest to him was to see me eat salt with it.  He made a sign to me\\nthat the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own\\nmouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,\\nwashing his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other hand, I took\\nsome meat into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter\\nfor want of salt, as much as he had done at the salt; but it would not\\ndo; he would never care for salt with meat or in his broth; at least, not\\nfor a great while, and then but a very little.\\nHaving thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved to feast\\nhim the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it\\nbefore the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England,\\nsetting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across the\\ntop, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn\\ncontinually.  This Friday admired very much; but when he came to taste\\nthe flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I\\ncould not but understand him: and at last he told me, as well as he\\ncould, he would never eat man’s flesh any more, which I was very glad to\\nhear.\\nThe next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and sifting it in\\nthe manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood how\\nto do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of\\nit was, and that it was to make bread of; for after that I let him see me\\nmake my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to\\ndo all the work for me as well as I could do it myself.\\nI began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one, I\\nmust provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of\\ncorn than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began\\nthe fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only\\nvery willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully: and I told him\\nwhat it was for; that it was for corn to make more bread, because he was\\nnow with me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too.  He\\nappeared very sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I\\nhad much more labour upon me on his account than I had for myself; and\\nthat he would work the harder for me if I would tell him what to do.\\nThis was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.\\nFriday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost\\neverything I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send\\nhim to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to\\nhave some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little\\noccasion for before.  Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a\\nsingular satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned\\nhonesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to\\nlove the creature; and on his side I believe he loved me more than it was\\npossible for him ever to love anything before.\\nI had a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country\\nagain; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me\\nalmost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to\\nnever conquered in battle?  At which he smiled, and said—“Yes, yes, we\\nalways fight the better;” that is, he meant always get the better in\\nfight; and so we began the following discourse:—\\n_Master_.—You always fight the better; how came you to be taken prisoner,\\nthen, Friday?\\n_Friday_.—My nation beat much for all that.\\n_Master_.—How beat?  If your nation beat them, how came you to be taken?\\n_Friday_.—They more many than my nation, in the place where me was; they\\ntake one, two, three, and me: my nation over-beat them in the yonder\\nplace, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great thousand.\\n_Master_.—But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your\\nenemies, then?\\n_Friday_.—They run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe; my\\nnation have no canoe that time.\\n_Master_.—Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men they\\ntake?  Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did?\\n_Friday_.—Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.\\n_Master_.—Where do they carry them?\\n_Friday_.—Go to other place, where they think.\\n_Master_.—Do they come hither?\\n_Friday_.—Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else place.\\n_Master_.—Have you been here with them?\\n_Friday_.—Yes, I have been here (points to the NW. side of the island,\\nwhich, it seems, was their side).\\nBy this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the\\nsavages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, on\\nthe same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and some time\\nafter, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same\\nI formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he was\\nthere once, when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child; he\\ncould not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying so many\\nstones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.\\nI have told this passage, because it introduces what follows: that after\\nthis discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island\\nto the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost.  He told me\\nthere was no danger, no canoes ever lost: but that after a little way out\\nto sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in the morning, the\\nother in the afternoon.  This I understood to be no more than the sets of\\nthe tide, as going out or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was\\noccasioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river Orinoco, in\\nthe mouth or gulf of which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay;\\nand that this land, which I perceived to be W. and NW., was the great\\nisland Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river.  I asked\\nFriday a thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea,\\nthe coast, and what nations were near; he told me all he knew with the\\ngreatest openness imaginable.  I asked him the names of the several\\nnations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs;\\nfrom whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which our\\nmaps place on the part of America which reaches from the mouth of the\\nriver Orinoco to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.  He told me that up a\\ngreat way beyond the moon, that was beyond the setting of the moon, which\\nmust be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me,\\nand pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they\\nhad killed much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood he\\nmeant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the\\nwhole country, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.\\nI inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island, and get\\namong those white men.  He told me, “Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe.”\\nI could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he\\nmeant by two canoe, till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant\\nit must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.  This part of Friday’s\\ndiscourse I began to relish very well; and from this time I entertained\\nsome hopes that, one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make\\nmy escape from this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to\\nhelp me.\\nDuring the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he began\\nto speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation\\nof religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him one time,\\nwho made him.  The creature did not understand me at all, but thought I\\nhad asked who was his father—but I took it up by another handle, and\\nasked him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills and\\nwoods.  He told me, “It was one Benamuckee, that lived beyond all;” he\\ncould describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old,\\n“much older,” he said, “than the sea or land, than the moon or the\\nstars.”  I asked him then, if this old person had made all things, why\\ndid not all things worship him?  He looked very grave, and, with a\\nperfect look of innocence, said, “All things say O to him.”  I asked him\\nif the people who die in his country went away anywhere?  He said, “Yes;\\nthey all went to Benamuckee.”  Then I asked him whether those they eat up\\nwent thither too.  He said, “Yes.”\\nFrom these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true\\nGod; I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there,\\npointing up towards heaven; that He governed the world by the same power\\nand providence by which He made it; that He was omnipotent, and could do\\neverything for us, give everything to us, take everything from us; and\\nthus, by degrees, I opened his eyes.  He listened with great attention,\\nand received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to\\nredeem us; and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and His being\\nable to hear us, even in heaven.  He told me one day, that if our God\\ncould hear us, up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than\\ntheir Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear\\ntill they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to them.\\nI asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him.  He said, “No; they\\nnever went that were young men; none went thither but the old men,” whom\\nhe called their Oowokakee; that is, as I made him explain to me, their\\nreligious, or clergy; and that they went to say O (so he called saying\\nprayers), and then came back and told them what Benamuckee said.  By this\\nI observed, that there is priestcraft even among the most blinded,\\nignorant pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret of\\nreligion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the\\nclergy, not only to be found in the Roman, but, perhaps, among all\\nreligions in the world, even among the most brutish and barbarous\\nsavages.\\nI endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him that\\nthe pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say O to their\\ngod Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he\\nsaid was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or spake with\\nany one there, it must be with an evil spirit; and then I entered into a\\nlong discourse with him about the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion\\nagainst God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up\\nin the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as\\nGod, and the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their\\nruin; how he had a secret access to our passions and to our affections,\\nand to adapt his snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be\\nour own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own choice.\\nI found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about the\\ndevil as it was about the being of a God.  Nature assisted all my\\narguments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause,\\nan overruling, governing Power, a secret directing Providence, and of the\\nequity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us, and the like;\\nbut there appeared nothing of this kind in the notion of an evil spirit,\\nof his origin, his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination\\nto do evil, and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor creature puzzled\\nme once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and innocent, that\\nI scarce knew what to say to him.  I had been talking a great deal to him\\nof the power of God, His omnipotence, His aversion to sin, His being a\\nconsuming fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us all, He\\ncould destroy us and all the world in a moment; and he listened with\\ngreat seriousness to me all the while.  After this I had been telling him\\nhow the devil was God’s enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his\\nmalice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin\\nthe kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like.  “Well,” says Friday,\\n“but you say God is so strong, so great; is He not much strong, much\\nmight as the devil?”  “Yes, yes,” says I, “Friday; God is stronger than\\nthe devil—God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread\\nhim down under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations and\\nquench his fiery darts.”  “But,” says he again, “if God much stronger,\\nmuch might as the wicked devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no\\nmore do wicked?”  I was strangely surprised at this question; and, after\\nall, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill\\nqualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties; and at first I could\\nnot tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what\\nhe said; but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his question, so\\nthat he repeated it in the very same broken words as above.  By this time\\nI had recovered myself a little, and I said, “God will at last punish him\\nseverely; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the\\nbottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire.”  This did not satisfy\\nFriday; but he returns upon me, repeating my words, “‘_Reserve at last_!’\\nme no understand—but why not kill the devil now; not kill great ago?”\\n“You may as well ask me,” said I, “why God does not kill you or me, when\\nwe do wicked things here that offend Him—we are preserved to repent and\\nbe pardoned.”  He mused some time on this.  “Well, well,” says he, mighty\\naffectionately, “that well—so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve,\\nrepent, God pardon all.”  Here I was run down again by him to the last\\ndegree; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,\\nthough they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,\\nand of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of God, as the\\nconsequence of our nature, yet nothing but divine revelation can form the\\nknowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemption purchased for us; of a\\nMediator of the new covenant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of\\nGod’s throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven can form these\\nin the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel of our Lord and Saviour\\nJesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for\\nthe guide and sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely necessary\\ninstructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of God and the\\nmeans of salvation.\\nI therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my man, rising\\nup hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going out; then sending him\\nfor something a good way off, I seriously prayed to God that He would\\nenable me to instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by His\\nSpirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the light of\\nthe knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to Himself, and would\\nguide me so to speak to him from the Word of God that his conscience\\nmight be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved.  When he came\\nagain to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject of\\nthe redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of\\nthe gospel preached from Heaven, viz. of repentance towards God, and\\nfaith in our blessed Lord Jesus.  I then explained to him as well as I\\ncould why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature of angels but\\nthe seed of Abraham; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no\\nshare in the redemption; that He came only to the lost sheep of the house\\nof Israel, and the like.\\nI had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I took\\nfor this poor creature’s instruction, and must acknowledge, what I\\nbelieve all that act upon the same principle will find, that in laying\\nthings open to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many\\nthings that either I did not know or had not fully considered before, but\\nwhich occurred naturally to my mind upon searching into them, for the\\ninformation of this poor savage; and I had more affection in my inquiry\\nafter things upon this occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether\\nthis poor wild wretch was better for me or no, I had great reason to be\\nthankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter, upon me; my\\nhabitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure: and when I reflected\\nthat in this solitary life which I have been confined to, I had not only\\nbeen moved to look up to heaven myself, and to seek the Hand that had\\nbrought me here, but was now to be made an instrument, under Providence,\\nto save the life, and, for aught I knew, the soul of a poor savage, and\\nbring him to the true knowledge of religion and of the Christian\\ndoctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; I\\nsay, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran through\\nevery part of My soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought\\nto this place, which I had so often thought the most dreadful of all\\nafflictions that could possibly have befallen me.\\nI continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of my time; and the\\nconversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such as\\nmade the three years which we lived there together perfectly and\\ncompletely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be formed\\nin a sublunary state.  This savage was now a good Christian, a much\\nbetter than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that\\nwe were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents.  We had here\\nthe Word of God to read, and no farther off from His Spirit to instruct\\nthan if we had been in England.  I always applied myself, in reading the\\nScripture, to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what I\\nread; and he again, by his serious inquiries and questionings, made me,\\nas I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I\\nshould ever have been by my own mere private reading.  Another thing I\\ncannot refrain from observing here also, from experience in this retired\\npart of my life, viz. how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is\\nthat the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by Christ\\nJesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word of God, so easy to be received\\nand understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable\\nof understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great\\nwork of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for\\nlife and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience to\\nall God’s commands, and this without any teacher or instructor, I mean\\nhuman; so the same plain instruction sufficiently served to the\\nenlightening this savage creature, and bringing him to be such a\\nChristian as I have known few equal to him in my life.\\nAs to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and contention which have\\nhappened in the world about religion, whether niceties in doctrines or\\nschemes of church government, they were all perfectly useless to us, and,\\nfor aught I can yet see, they have been so to the rest of the world.  We\\nhad the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God; and we had, blessed\\nbe God, comfortable views of the Spirit of God teaching and instructing\\nby His word, leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and\\nobedient to the instruction of His word.  And I cannot see the least use\\nthat the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of religion, which\\nhave made such confusion in the world, would have been to us, if we could\\nhave obtained it.  But I must go on with the historical part of things,\\nand take every part in its order.\\nAfter Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could\\nunderstand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though in\\nbroken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at least\\nso much of it as related to my coming to this place: how I had lived\\nthere, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him,\\nof gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot.  I gave him a\\nknife, which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt,\\nwith a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and in\\nthe frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only\\nas good a weapon in some cases, but much more useful upon other\\noccasions.\\nI described to him the country of Europe, particularly England, which I\\ncame from; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one\\nanother, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world.  I gave\\nhim an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him,\\nas near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in\\npieces before, and gone.  I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we\\nlost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength\\nthen; but was now fallen almost all to pieces.  Upon seeing this boat,\\nFriday stood, musing a great while, and said nothing.  I asked him what\\nit was he studied upon.  At last says he, “Me see such boat like come to\\nplace at my nation.”  I did not understand him a good while; but at last,\\nwhen I had examined further into it, I understood by him that a boat,\\nsuch as that had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived:\\nthat is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather.  I\\npresently imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon\\ntheir coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore; but was so\\ndull that I never once thought of men making their escape from a wreck\\nthither, much less whence they might come: so I only inquired after a\\ndescription of the boat.\\nFriday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to\\nunderstand him when he added with some warmth, “We save the white mans\\nfrom drown.”  Then I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he\\ncalled them, in the boat.  “Yes,” he said; “the boat full of white mans.”\\nI asked him how many.  He told upon his fingers seventeen.  I asked him\\nthen what became of them.  He told me, “They live, they dwell at my\\nnation.”\\nThis put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these\\nmight be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight of\\nmy island, as I now called it; and who, after the ship was struck on the\\nrock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their\\nboat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.  Upon this\\nI inquired of him more critically what was become of them.  He assured me\\nthey lived still there; that they had been there about four years; that\\nthe savages left them alone, and gave them victuals to live on.  I asked\\nhim how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them.  He said,\\n“No, they make brother with them;” that is, as I understood him, a truce;\\nand then he added, “They no eat mans but when make the war fight;” that\\nis to say, they never eat any men but such as come to fight with them and\\nare taken in battle.\\nIt was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the\\nhill at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I had,\\nin a clear day, discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, the\\nweather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the mainland,\\nand, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to\\nme, for I was at some distance from him.  I asked him what was the\\nmatter.  “Oh, joy!” says he; “Oh, glad! there see my country, there my\\nnation!”  I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his\\nface, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange\\neagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again.  This\\nobservation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me at\\nfirst not so easy about my new man Friday as I was before; and I made no\\ndoubt but that, if Friday could get back to his own nation again, he\\nwould not only forget all his religion but all his obligation to me, and\\nwould be forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come\\nback, perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at\\nwhich he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies\\nwhen they were taken in war.  But I wronged the poor honest creature very\\nmuch, for which I was very sorry afterwards.  However, as my jealousy\\nincreased, and held some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not\\nso familiar and kind to him as before: in which I was certainly wrong\\ntoo; the honest, grateful creature having no thought about it but what\\nconsisted with the best principles, both as a religious Christian and as\\na grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full satisfaction.\\nWhile my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day pumping\\nhim to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected\\nwere in him; but I found everything he said was so honest and so\\ninnocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and in spite\\nof all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor did\\nhe in the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not\\nsuspect him of deceit.\\nOne day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea, so\\nthat we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, “Friday,\\ndo not you wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?”  “Yes,”\\nhe said, “I be much O glad to be at my own nation.”  “What would you do\\nthere?” said I.  “Would you turn wild again, eat men’s flesh again, and\\nbe a savage as you were before?”  He looked full of concern, and shaking\\nhis head, said, “No, no, Friday tell them to live good; tell them to pray\\nGod; tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle flesh, milk; no eat man again.”\\n“Why, then,” said I to him, “they will kill you.”  He looked grave at\\nthat, and then said, “No, no, they no kill me, they willing love learn.”\\nHe meant by this, they would be willing to learn.  He added, they learned\\nmuch of the bearded mans that came in the boat.  Then I asked him if he\\nwould go back to them.  He smiled at that, and told me that he could not\\nswim so far.  I told him I would make a canoe for him.  He told me he\\nwould go if I would go with him.  “I go!” says I; “why, they will eat me\\nif I come there.”  “No, no,” says he, “me make they no eat you; me make\\nthey much love you.”  He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his\\nenemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them love me.  Then he\\ntold me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white men,\\nor bearded men, as he called them who came on shore there in distress.\\nFrom this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I\\ncould possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were\\nSpaniards and Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find\\nsome method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good\\ncompany together, better than I could from an island forty miles off the\\nshore, alone and without help.  So, after some days, I took Friday to\\nwork again by way of discourse, and told him I would give him a boat to\\ngo back to his own nation; and, accordingly, I carried him to my frigate,\\nwhich lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it of water\\n(for I always kept it sunk in water), I brought it out, showed it him,\\nand we both went into it.  I found he was a most dexterous fellow at\\nmanaging it, and would make it go almost as swift again as I could.  So\\nwhen he was in, I said to him, “Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your\\nnation?”  He looked very dull at my saying so; which it seems was because\\nhe thought the boat was too small to go so far.  I then told him I had a\\nbigger; so the next day I went to the place where the first boat lay\\nwhich I had made, but which I could not get into the water.  He said that\\nwas big enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain\\ntwo or three and twenty years there, the sun had so split and dried it,\\nthat it was rotten.  Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and\\nwould carry “much enough vittle, drink, bread;” this was his way of\\ntalking.\\nCHAPTER XVI—RESCUE OF PRISONERS FROM CANNIBALS\\nUpon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over\\nwith him to the continent that I told him we would go and make one as big\\nas that, and he should go home in it.  He answered not one word, but\\nlooked very grave and sad.  I asked him what was the matter with him.  He\\nasked me again, “Why you angry mad with Friday?—what me done?”  I asked\\nhim what he meant.  I told him I was not angry with him at all.  “No\\nangry!” says he, repeating the words several times; “why send Friday home\\naway to my nation?”  “Why,” says I, “Friday, did not you say you wished\\nyou were there?”  “Yes, yes,” says he, “wish we both there; no wish\\nFriday there, no master there.”  In a word, he would not think of going\\nthere without me.  “I go there, Friday?” says I; “what shall I do there?”\\nHe turned very quick upon me at this.  “You do great deal much good,”\\nsays he; “you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans; you tell them\\nknow God, pray God, and live new life.”  “Alas, Friday!” says I, “thou\\nknowest not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself.”  “Yes,\\nyes,” says he, “you teachee me good, you teachee them good.”  “No, no,\\nFriday,” says I, “you shall go without me; leave me here to live by\\nmyself, as I did before.”  He looked confused again at that word; and\\nrunning to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up\\nhastily, and gives it to me.  “What must I do with this?” says I to him.\\n“You take kill Friday,” says he.  “What must kill you for?” said I again.\\nHe returns very quick—“What you send Friday away for?  Take kill Friday,\\nno send Friday away.”  This he spoke so earnestly that I saw tears stand\\nin his eyes.  In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in\\nhim to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then and often\\nafter, that I would never send him away from me if he was willing to stay\\nwith me.\\nUpon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to\\nme, and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the\\nfoundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent\\naffection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing\\nwhich, as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought or\\nintention, or desire of undertaking it.  But still I found a strong\\ninclination to attempting my escape, founded on the supposition gathered\\nfrom the discourse, that there were seventeen bearded men there; and\\ntherefore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday to find out\\na great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to\\nundertake the voyage.  There were trees enough in the island to have\\nbuilt a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good, large\\nvessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water\\nthat we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I\\ncommitted at first.  At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he\\nknew much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I\\ntell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it\\nwas very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua\\nwood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.  Friday wished to\\nburn the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but I\\nshowed him how to cut it with tools; which, after I had showed him how to\\nuse, he did very handily; and in about a month’s hard labour we finished\\nit and made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which I\\nshowed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true\\nshape of a boat.  After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight’s time\\nto get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the\\nwater; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men with great\\nease.\\nWhen she was in the water, though she was so big, it amazed me to see\\nwith what dexterity and how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn\\nher, and paddle her along.  So I asked him if he would, and if we might\\nventure over in her.  “Yes,” he said, “we venture over in her very well,\\nthough great blow wind.”  However I had a further design that he knew\\nnothing of, and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with\\nan anchor and cable.  As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I\\npitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place,\\nand which there were great plenty of in the island, and I set Friday to\\nwork to cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape and order it.\\nBut as to the sail, that was my particular care.  I knew I had old sails,\\nor rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them now\\nsix-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve\\nthem, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I\\ndid not doubt but they were all rotten; and, indeed, most of them were\\nso.  However, I found two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with\\nthese I went to work; and with a great deal of pains, and awkward\\nstitching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a\\nthree-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in England a\\nshoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short\\nsprit at the top, such as usually our ships’ long-boats sail with, and\\nsuch as I best knew how to manage, as it was such a one as I had to the\\nboat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part\\nof my story.\\nI was near two months performing this last work, viz. rigging and fitting\\nmy masts and sails; for I finished them very complete, making a small\\nstay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist if we should turn to\\nwindward; and, what was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of\\nher to steer with.  I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the\\nusefulness and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so\\nmuch pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass; though,\\nconsidering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think\\nit cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.\\nAfter all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged\\nto the navigation of my boat; though he knew very well how to paddle a\\ncanoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was\\nthe most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by\\nthe rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this way or that way as\\nthe course we sailed changed; I say when he saw this he stood like one\\nastonished and amazed.  However, with a little use, I made all these\\nthings familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that of\\nthe compass I could make him understand very little.  On the other hand,\\nas there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in\\nthose parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars\\nwere always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the\\nrainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or\\nsea.\\nI was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in this\\nplace; though the three last years that I had this creature with me ought\\nrather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of\\nanother kind than in all the rest of the time.  I kept the anniversary of\\nmy landing here with the same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at\\nfirst: and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much\\nmore so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence\\nover me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily\\ndelivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my\\ndeliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this\\nplace.  I went on, however, with my husbandry; digging, planting, and\\nfencing as usual.  I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every\\nnecessary thing as before.\\nThe rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept more within\\ndoors than at other times.  We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we\\ncould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning,\\nI landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the shore at\\nhigh-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough\\nto hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in;\\nand then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of\\nit, to keep the water out; and so she lay, dry as to the tide from the\\nsea: and to keep the rain off we laid a great many boughs of trees, so\\nthick that she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we waited for\\nthe months of November and December, in which I designed to make my\\nadventure.\\nWhen the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design\\nreturned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage.\\nAnd the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions,\\nbeing the stores for our voyage; and intended in a week or a fortnight’s\\ntime to open the dock, and launch out our boat.  I was busy one morning\\nupon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him to go\\nto the sea-shore and see if he could find a turtle or a tortoise, a thing\\nwhich we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as\\nthe flesh.  Friday had not been long gone when he came running back, and\\nflew over my outer wall or fence, like one that felt not the ground or\\nthe steps he set his foot on; and before I had time to speak to him he\\ncries out to me, “O master! O master! O sorrow! O bad!”—“What’s the\\nmatter, Friday?” says I.  “O yonder there,” says he, “one, two, three\\ncanoes; one, two, three!”  By this way of speaking I concluded there were\\nsix; but on inquiry I found there were but three.  “Well, Friday,” says\\nI, “do not be frightened.”  So I heartened him up as well as I could.\\nHowever, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared, for nothing ran\\nin his head but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in\\npieces and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so that I scarcely knew\\nwhat to do with him.  I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I\\nwas in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him.\\n“But,” says I, “Friday, we must resolve to fight them.  Can you fight,\\nFriday?”  “Me shoot,” says he, “but there come many great number.”  “No\\nmatter for that,” said I again; “our guns will fright them that we do not\\nkill.”  So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would\\ndefend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him.  He said, “Me die\\nwhen you bid die, master.”  So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and\\ngave him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum that I had a great\\ndeal left.  When we had drunk it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces,\\nwhich we always carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as\\nsmall pistol-bullets.  Then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two\\nslugs and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a\\nbrace of bullets each.  I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my\\nside, and gave Friday his hatchet.  When I had thus prepared myself, I\\ntook my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see\\nwhat I could discover; and I found quickly by my glass that there were\\none-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and that their\\nwhole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human\\nbodies: a barbarous feast, indeed! but nothing more than, as I had\\nobserved, was usual with them.  I observed also that they had landed, not\\nwhere they had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,\\nwhere the shore was low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to\\nthe sea.  This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches\\ncame about, filled me with such indignation that I came down again to\\nFriday, and told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill them all;\\nand asked him if he would stand by me.  He had now got over his fright,\\nand his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he\\nwas very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die.\\nIn this fit of fury I divided the arms which I had charged, as before,\\nbetween us; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three\\nguns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and the other three guns\\nmyself; and in this posture we marched out.  I took a small bottle of rum\\nin my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets;\\nand as to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir,\\nor shoot, or do anything till I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak\\na word.  In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a\\nmile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, so that I\\ncould come within shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had\\nseen by my glass it was easy to do.\\nWhile I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to\\nabate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their\\nnumber, for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was\\nsuperior to them—nay, though I had been alone.  But it occurred to my\\nthoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in to\\ngo and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or\\nintended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous\\ncustoms were their own disaster, being in them a token, indeed, of God’s\\nhaving left them, with the other nations of that part of the world, to\\nsuch stupidity, and to such inhuman courses, but did not call me to take\\nupon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of His\\njustice—that whenever He thought fit He would take the cause into His own\\nhands, and by national vengeance punish them as a people for national\\ncrimes, but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business—that it was\\ntrue Friday might justify it, because he was a declared enemy and in a\\nstate of war with those very particular people, and it was lawful for him\\nto attack them—but I could not say the same with regard to myself.  These\\nthings were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went,\\nthat I resolved I would only go and place myself near them that I might\\nobserve their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as God should\\ndirect; but that unless something offered that was more a call to me than\\nyet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.\\nWith this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible wariness\\nand silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came to\\nthe skirts of the wood on the side which was next to them, only that one\\ncorner of the wood lay between me and them.  Here I called softly to\\nFriday, and showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the\\nwood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there\\nplainly what they were doing.  He did so, and came immediately back to\\nme, and told me they might be plainly viewed there—that they were all\\nabout their fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that\\nanother lay bound upon the sand a little from them, whom he said they\\nwould kill next; and this fired the very soul within me.  He told me it\\nwas not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he had told me\\nof, that came to their country in the boat.  I was filled with horror at\\nthe very naming of the white bearded man; and going to the tree, I saw\\nplainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea with\\nhis hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that\\nhe was an European, and had clothes on.\\nThere was another tree and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards\\nnearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a little way\\nabout, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be\\nwithin half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed\\nenraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got\\nbehind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree,\\nand then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of\\nthem at the distance of about eighty yards.\\nI had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat\\nupon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other\\ntwo to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb to\\ntheir fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet.\\nI turned to Friday.  “Now, Friday,” said I, “do as I bid thee.”  Friday\\nsaid he would.  “Then, Friday,” says I, “do exactly as you see me do;\\nfail in nothing.”  So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece\\nupon the ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other\\nmusket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like; then\\nasking him if he was ready, he said, “Yes.”  “Then fire at them,” said I;\\nand at the same moment I fired also.\\nFriday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he shot\\nhe killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I killed\\none, and wounded two.  They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful\\nconsternation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their feet,\\nbut did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for\\nthey knew not from whence their destruction came.  Friday kept his eyes\\nclose upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so,\\nas soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up\\nthe fowling-piece, and Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present;\\nhe did the same again.  “Are you ready, Friday?” said I.  “Yes,” says he.\\n“Let fly, then,” says I, “in the name of God!” and with that I fired\\nagain among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces\\nwere now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we\\nfound only two drop; but so many were wounded that they ran about yelling\\nand screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably\\nwounded; whereof three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.\\n“Now, Friday,” says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up\\nthe musket which was yet loaded, “follow me,” which he did with a great\\ndeal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself,\\nand Friday close at my foot.  As soon as I perceived they saw me, I\\nshouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as\\nfast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being loaded with\\narms as I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I\\nsaid, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place where they sat and\\nthe sea.  The two butchers who were just going to work with him had left\\nhim at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to\\nthe seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made\\nthe same way.  I turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards and fire at\\nthem; he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be\\nnearer them, he shot at them; and I thought he had killed them all, for I\\nsaw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up\\nagain quickly; however, he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so\\nthat he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had been dead.\\nWhile my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the\\nflags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, I\\nlifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was.  He\\nanswered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could\\nscarce stand or speak.  I took my bottle out of my pocket and gave it\\nhim, making signs that he should drink, which he did; and I gave him a\\npiece of bread, which he ate.  Then I asked him what countryman he was:\\nand he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know, by\\nall the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for his\\ndeliverance.  “Seignior,” said I, with as much Spanish as I could make\\nup, “we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if you have any\\nstrength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.”  He took\\nthem very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as\\nif they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a\\nfury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is,\\nas the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much\\nfrightened with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for mere\\namazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt their own escape\\nthan their flesh had to resist our shot; and that was the case of those\\nfive that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the\\nhurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright.\\nI kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep my\\ncharge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I\\ncalled to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first\\nfired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which\\nhe did with great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I sat down\\nmyself to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they\\nwanted.  While I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce\\nengagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him\\nwith one of their great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have killed\\nhim before, if I had not prevented it.  The Spaniard, who was as bold and\\nbrave as could be imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian a good\\nwhile, and had cut two great wounds on his head; but the savage being a\\nstout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down, being\\nfaint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand; when the Spaniard,\\nthough undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his\\ngirdle, shot the savage through the body, and killed him upon the spot,\\nbefore I, who was running to help him, could come near him.\\nFriday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, with\\nno weapon in his hand but his hatchet: and with that he despatched those\\nthree who as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all\\nthe rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun,\\nI gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the\\nsavages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run, they both\\ngot from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of\\nthem, but the other was too nimble for him; and though he was wounded,\\nyet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam with all his might off to\\nthose two who were left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with one\\nwounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped\\nour hands of one-and-twenty.  The account of the whole is as follows:\\nThree killed at our first shot from the tree; two killed at the next\\nshot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday of those at\\nfirst wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the\\nSpaniard; four killed, being found dropped here and there, of the wounds,\\nor killed by Friday in his chase of them; four escaped in the boat,\\nwhereof one wounded, if not dead—twenty-one in all.\\nThose that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and\\nthough Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit\\nany of them.  Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes, and\\npursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their escape, lest,\\ncarrying the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps\\nwith two or three hundred of the canoes and devour us by mere multitude;\\nso I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes,\\nI jumped in and bade Friday follow me: but when I was in the canoe I was\\nsurprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot,\\nas the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not\\nknowing what was the matter; for he had not been able to look up over the\\nside of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied\\nso long that he had really but little life in him.\\nI immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound him\\nwith, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak, but\\ngroaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only\\nunbound in order to be killed.  When Friday came to him I bade him speak\\nto him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made\\nhim give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being\\ndelivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat.  But when Friday came\\nto hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved any one to\\ntears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,\\ncried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sang; then cried again,\\nwrung his hands, beat his own face and head; and then sang and jumped\\nabout again like a distracted creature.  It was a good while before I\\ncould make him speak to me or tell me what was the matter; but when he\\ncame a little to himself he told me that it was his father.\\nIt is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and\\nfilial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his\\nfather, and of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I describe\\nhalf the extravagances of his affection after this: for he went into the\\nboat and out of the boat a great many times: when he went in to him he\\nwould sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father’s head close\\nto his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his\\narms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed\\nand rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave\\nhim some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great\\ndeal of good.\\nThis affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other\\nsavages, who were now almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that\\nwe did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they\\ncould be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all\\nnight, and that from the north-west, which was against them, that I could\\nnot suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their own\\ncoast.\\nBut to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father that I could not\\nfind in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought he\\ncould leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and\\nlaughing, and pleased to the highest extreme: then I asked him if he had\\ngiven his father any bread.  He shook his head, and said, “None; ugly dog\\neat all up self.”  I then gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch\\nI carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself; but he would\\nnot taste it, but carried it to his father.  I had in my pocket two or\\nthree bunches of raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father.\\nHe had no sooner given his father these raisins but I saw him come out of\\nthe boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched, for he was the\\nswiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw: I say, he ran at such a rate\\nthat he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called,\\nand hallooed out too after him, it was all one—away he went; and in a\\nquarter of an hour I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he\\nwent; and as he came nearer I found his pace slacker, because he had\\nsomething in his hand.  When he came up to me I found he had been quite\\nhome for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and\\nthat he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread: the bread he gave me,\\nbut the water he carried to his father; however, as I was very thirsty\\ntoo, I took a little of it.  The water revived his father more than all\\nthe rum or spirits I had given him, for he was fainting with thirst.\\nWhen his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any water\\nleft.  He said, “Yes”; and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who\\nwas in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes that\\nFriday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was\\nreposing himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree; and whose\\nlimbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with the rude bandage\\nhe had been tied with.  When I saw that upon Friday’s coming to him with\\nthe water he sat up and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I\\nwent to him and gave him a handful of raisins.  He looked up in my face\\nwith all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in\\nany countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted\\nhimself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon his feet—he tried\\nto do it two or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were so\\nswelled and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday\\nto rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father’s.\\nI observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps\\nless, all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if his father\\nwas in the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at last he\\nfound he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and, without\\nspeaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one could scarce\\nperceive his feet to touch the ground as he went; but when he came, he\\nonly found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday came\\nback to me presently; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help\\nhim up if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should carry\\nhim to our dwelling, where I would take care of him.  But Friday, a\\nlusty, strong fellow, took the Spaniard upon his back, and carried him\\naway to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the\\ncanoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then lifting him quite in,\\nhe set him close to his father; and presently stepping out again,\\nlaunched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could\\nwalk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both safe\\ninto our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other\\ncanoe.  As he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went.\\nHe told me, “Go fetch more boat;” so away he went like the wind, for sure\\nnever man or horse ran like him; and he had the other canoe in the creek\\nalmost as soon as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then\\nwent to help our new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were\\nneither of them able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.\\nTo remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to\\nbid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of\\nhand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up\\ntogether upon it between us.\\nBut when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification, we\\nwere at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over,\\nand I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again, and\\nFriday and I, in about two hours’ time, made a very handsome tent,\\ncovered with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the\\nspace without our outward fence and between that and the grove of young\\nwood which I had planted; and here we made them two beds of such things\\nas I had—viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on,\\nand another to cover them, on each bed.\\nMy island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;\\nand it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king I\\nlooked.  First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that I\\nhad an undoubted right of dominion.  Secondly, my people were perfectly\\nsubjected—I was absolutely lord and lawgiver—they all owed their lives to\\nme, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion\\nfor it, for me.  It was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and\\nthey were of three different religions—my man Friday was a Protestant,\\nhis father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist.\\nHowever, I allowed liberty of conscience throughout my dominions.  But\\nthis is by the way.\\nAs soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued prisoners, and given them\\nshelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some\\nprovision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a\\nyearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to\\nbe killed; when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into small\\npieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very\\ngood dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; and as I cooked it without\\ndoors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into\\nthe new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat down, and ate\\nmy own dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, cheered them and\\nencouraged them.  Friday was my interpreter, especially to his father,\\nand, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of\\nthe savages pretty well.\\nAfter we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of the\\ncanoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for want\\nof time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the next day I ordered\\nhim to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the\\nsun, and would presently be offensive.  I also ordered him to bury the\\nhorrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing\\nmyself; nay, I could not bear to see them if I went that way; all which\\nhe punctually performed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages\\nbeing there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was,\\notherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the place.\\nI then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new\\nsubjects; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he\\nthought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might\\nexpect a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist.  His\\nfirst opinion was, that the savages in the boat never could live out the\\nstorm which blew that night they went off, but must of necessity be\\ndrowned, or driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure\\nto be devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but, as\\nto what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not;\\nbut it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frightened with the\\nmanner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed\\nthey would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning,\\nnot by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared—viz. Friday and\\nI—were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and\\nnot men with weapons.  This, he said, he knew; because he heard them all\\ncry out so, in their language, one to another; for it was impossible for\\nthem to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill\\nat a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now: and this old\\nsavage was in the right; for, as I understood since, by other hands, the\\nsavages never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so\\nterrified with the accounts given by those four men (for it seems they\\ndid escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted\\nisland would be destroyed with fire from the gods.  This, however, I knew\\nnot; and therefore was under continual apprehensions for a good while,\\nand kept always upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now\\nfour of us, I would have ventured upon a hundred of them, fairly in the\\nopen field, at any time.\\nCHAPTER XVII—VISIT OF MUTINEERS\\nIn a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their\\ncoming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to\\nthe main into consideration; being likewise assured by Friday’s father\\nthat I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if\\nI would go.  But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious\\ndiscourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were\\nsixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away\\nand made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with\\nthe savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed,\\nfor life.  I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found\\nthey were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,\\nbeing directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and\\nsilver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there;\\nthat they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of\\nanother wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when first the\\nship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite dangers and\\nhazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they\\nexpected to have been devoured every moment.  He told me they had some\\narms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had\\nneither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their\\npowder but a little, which they used at their first landing to provide\\nthemselves with some food.\\nI asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had\\nformed any design of making their escape.  He said they had many\\nconsultations about it; but that having neither vessel nor tools to build\\none, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and\\ndespair.  I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from\\nme, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all\\nhere, it might not be done.  I told him with freedom, I feared mostly\\ntheir treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; for\\nthat gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men\\nalways square their dealings by the obligations they had received so much\\nas they did by the advantages they expected.  I told him it would be very\\nhard that I should be made the instrument of their deliverance, and that\\nthey should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where an\\nEnglishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what\\naccident soever brought him thither; and that I had rather be delivered\\nup to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless\\nclaws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition.  I added that,\\notherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many\\nhands, build a barque large enough to carry us all away, either to the\\nBrazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that\\nif, in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands,\\ncarry me by force among their own people, I might be ill-used for my\\nkindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.\\nHe answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their\\ncondition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he\\nbelieved they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that\\nshould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would\\ngo to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return\\nagain and bring me their answer; that he would make conditions with them\\nupon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction\\nas their commander and captain; and they should swear upon the holy\\nsacraments and gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country\\nas I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and\\nabsolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as I\\nintended, and that he would bring a contract from them, under their\\nhands, for that purpose.  Then he told me he would first swear to me\\nhimself that he would never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave\\nhim orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood,\\nif there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.\\nHe told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and they were\\nunder the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor\\nclothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;\\nout of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he was\\nsure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.\\nUpon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if\\npossible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to\\ntreat.  But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard\\nhimself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one\\nhand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be\\nvery well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of\\nhis comrades for at least half a year.  The case was thus: he had been\\nwith us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what\\nmanner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support;\\nand he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up; which,\\nthough it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient,\\nwithout good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four; but\\nmuch less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said,\\nsixteen, still alive, should come over; and least of all would it be\\nsufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to\\nany of the Christian colonies of America; so he told me he thought it\\nwould be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate\\nsome more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we should\\nwait another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his\\ncountrymen, when they should come; for want might be a temptation to them\\nto disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of\\none difficulty into another.  “You know,” says he, “the children of\\nIsrael, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of\\nEgypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when\\nthey came to want bread in the wilderness.”\\nHis caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not\\nbut be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied\\nwith his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the\\nwooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a month’s\\ntime, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured\\nand trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and\\nsixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare:\\nindeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food for the six\\nmonths that we had to expect our crop; that is to say reckoning from the\\ntime we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is\\nsix months in the ground in that country.\\nHaving now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us out\\nof fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been\\nvery great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found\\noccasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it\\nwas impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.\\nFor this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our\\nwork, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I caused\\nthe Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee\\nand direct their work.  I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had\\nhewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like,\\ntill they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak, near two feet\\nbroad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick:\\nwhat prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.\\nAt the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as\\nmuch as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go\\nout one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our turns),\\nand by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the\\nrest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to\\nour flock.  But above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I\\ncaused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I\\nbelieve, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured,\\nwe could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread,\\nformed a great part of our food—very good living too, I assure you, for\\nthey are exceedingly nourishing.\\nIt was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most\\nplentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough\\nto answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in\\nand thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in\\nproportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next\\nharvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or,\\nif we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have\\nvictualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world; that is\\nto say, any part of America.  When we had thus housed and secured our\\nmagazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great\\nbaskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and\\ndexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some\\nthings for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.\\nAnd now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I\\ngave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do\\nwith those he had left behind him there.  I gave him a strict charge not\\nto bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself and\\nthe old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the\\nperson he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them\\nin order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him and\\ndefend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went would be\\nentirely under and subjected to his command; and that this should be put\\nin writing, and signed in their hands.  How they were to have done this,\\nwhen I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never\\nasked.  Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the\\nfather of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said\\nto have come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners\\nto be devoured by the savages.  I gave each of them a musket, with a\\nfirelock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them\\nto be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon\\nurgent occasions.\\nThis was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view of\\nmy deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days.  I gave them\\nprovisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for\\nmany days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards—for about eight days’\\ntime; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them\\nabout a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should\\nknow them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on\\nshore.  They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at\\nfull, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact\\nreckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it\\nagain; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be\\nsure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my\\naccount, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.\\nIt was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and\\nunforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been\\nheard of in history.  I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my\\nman Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master, master, they\\nare come, they are come!”  I jumped up, and regardless of danger I went,\\nas soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by\\nthe way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I say,\\nregardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not my custom to\\ndo; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw\\na boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore,\\nwith a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing\\npretty fair to bring them in: also I observed, presently, that they did\\nnot come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost\\nend of the island.  Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close,\\nfor these were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know\\nyet whether they were friends or enemies.  In the next place I went in to\\nfetch my perspective glass to see what I could make of them; and having\\ntaken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to\\ndo when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer\\nwithout being discovered.  I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my\\neye plainly discovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a\\nhalf distance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the\\nshore.  By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and\\nthe boat appeared to be an English long-boat.\\nI cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship,\\nand one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and\\nconsequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some\\nsecret doubts hung about me—I cannot tell from whence they came—bidding\\nme keep upon my guard.  In the first place, it occurred to me to consider\\nwhat business an English ship could have in that part of the world, since\\nit was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had\\nany traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there\\nin distress; and that if they were really English it was most probable\\nthat they were here upon no good design; and that I had better continue\\nas I was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.\\nLet no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes\\nare given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being\\nreal.  That such hints and notices are given us I believe few that have\\nmade any observation of things can deny; that they are certain\\ndiscoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot\\ndoubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why\\nshould we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,\\nor inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are\\ngiven for our good?\\nThe present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this\\nreasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,\\ncome it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far\\nworse condition than before, as you will see presently.  I had not kept\\nmyself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as\\nif they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of\\nlanding; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see\\nthe little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on\\nshore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy\\nfor me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may\\nsay, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have\\nplundered me of all I had.  When they were on shore I was fully satisfied\\nthey were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were\\nDutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof\\nthree of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought, bound; and when the\\nfirst four or five of them were jumped on shore, they took those three\\nout of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using the\\nmost passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a\\nkind of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their\\nhands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree\\nas the first.  I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what\\nthe meaning of it should be.  Friday called out to me in English, as well\\nas he could, “O master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as\\nsavage mans.”  “Why, Friday,” says I, “do you think they are going to eat\\nthem, then?”  “Yes,” says Friday, “they will eat them.”  “No no,” says I,\\n“Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure\\nthey will not eat them.”\\nAll this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood\\ntrembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the\\nthree prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains\\nlift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to\\nstrike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every moment;\\nat which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins.  I\\nwished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that had gone with\\nhim, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,\\nthat I might have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had\\namong them; but it fell out to my mind another way.  After I had observed\\nthe outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed\\nthe fellows run scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the\\ncountry.  I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also\\nwhere they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very\\npensive, and looked like men in despair.  This put me in mind of the\\nfirst time when I came on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave\\nmyself over for lost; how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful\\napprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of\\nbeing devoured by wild beasts.  As I knew nothing that night of the\\nsupply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer\\nthe land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so long\\nnourished and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing\\nhow certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to them,\\nand how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the\\nsame time that they thought themselves lost and their case desperate.  So\\nlittle do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have we to\\ndepend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that He does not\\nleave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst\\ncircumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and\\nsometimes are nearer deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought\\nto their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to\\ntheir destruction.\\nIt was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while they\\nrambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had\\ncarelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed\\nconsiderably away, leaving their boat aground.  They had left two men in\\nthe boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much\\nbrandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the\\nother and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed\\nout for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they all soon\\ncame to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch her, the\\nboat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand,\\nalmost like a quicksand.  In this condition, like true seamen, who are,\\nperhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it\\nover, and away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of\\nthem say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, “Why, let her\\nalone, Jack, can’t you? she’ll float next tide;” by which I was fully\\nconfirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were.  All this\\nwhile I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle\\nany farther than to my place of observation near the top of the hill: and\\nvery glad I was to think how well it was fortified.  I knew it was no\\nless than ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time\\nit would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions,\\nand to hear their discourse, if they had any.  In the meantime I fitted\\nmyself up for a battle as before, though with more caution, knowing I had\\nto do with another kind of enemy than I had at first.  I ordered Friday\\nalso, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself\\nwith arms.  I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three\\nmuskets.  My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable\\ngoat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by\\nmy side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.\\nIt was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it\\nwas dark; but about two o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found that\\nthey were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid\\ndown to sleep.  The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their\\ncondition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a\\ngreat tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out\\nof sight of any of the rest.  Upon this I resolved to discover myself to\\nthem, and learn something of their condition; immediately I marched as\\nabove, my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his\\narms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I\\ndid.  I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any\\nof them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, “What are ye,\\ngentlemen?”  They started up at the noise, but were ten times more\\nconfounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made.  They\\nmade no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly\\nfrom me, when I spoke to them in English. “Gentlemen,” said I, “do not be\\nsurprised at me; perhaps you may have a friend near when you did not\\nexpect it.”  “He must be sent directly from heaven then,” said one of\\nthem very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me;\\n“for our condition is past the help of man.”  “All help is from heaven,\\nsir,” said I, “but can you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you\\nseem to be in some great distress.  I saw you when you landed; and when\\nyou seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you, I saw\\none of them lift up his sword to kill you.”\\nThe poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking\\nlike one astonished, returned, “Am I talking to God or man?  Is it a real\\nman or an angel?”  “Be in no fear about that, sir,” said I; “if God had\\nsent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and\\narmed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your fears; I\\nam a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one\\nservant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve\\nyou?  What is your case?”  “Our case, sir,” said he, “is too long to tell\\nyou while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was\\ncommander of that ship—my men have mutinied against me; they have been\\nhardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on shore\\nin this desolate place, with these two men with me—one my mate, the other\\na passenger—where we expected to perish, believing the place to be\\nuninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.”  “Where are these\\nbrutes, your enemies?” said I; “do you know where they are gone?  There\\nthey lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; “my heart\\ntrembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if they have,\\nthey will certainly murder us all.”  “Have they any firearms?” said I.\\nHe answered, “They had only two pieces, one of which they left in the\\nboat.”  “Well, then,” said I, “leave the rest to me; I see they are all\\nasleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take\\nthem prisoners?”  He told me there were two desperate villains among them\\nthat it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if they were secured,\\nhe believed all the rest would return to their duty.  I asked him which\\nthey were.  He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,\\nbut he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.  “Well,” says I,\\n“let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we\\nwill resolve further.”  So they willingly went back with me, till the\\nwoods covered us from them.\\n“Look you, sir,” said I, “if I venture upon your deliverance, are you\\nwilling to make two conditions with me?”  He anticipated my proposals by\\ntelling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly\\ndirected and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not\\nrecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world soever\\nI would send him; and the two other men said the same.  “Well,” says I,\\n“my conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this island\\nwith me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in\\nyour hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no\\nprejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the meantime be governed\\nby my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will\\ncarry me and my man to England passage free.”\\nHe gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could\\ndevise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and\\nbesides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions\\nas long as he lived.  “Well, then,” said I, “here are three muskets for\\nyou, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be\\ndone.”  He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,\\nbut offered to be wholly guided by me.  I told him I thought it was very\\nhard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to fire\\non them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the first\\nvolley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly\\nupon God’s providence to direct the shot.  He said, very modestly, that\\nhe was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that those two were\\nincorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the\\nship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still, for they would go\\non board and bring the whole ship’s company, and destroy us all.  “Well,\\nthen,” says I, “necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way\\nto save our lives.”  However, seeing him still cautious of shedding\\nblood, I told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found\\nconvenient.\\nIn the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon\\nafter we saw two of them on their feet.  I asked him if either of them\\nwere the heads of the mutiny?  He said, “No.”  “Well, then,” said I, “you\\nmay let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on\\npurpose to save themselves.  Now,” says I, “if the rest escape you, it is\\nyour fault.”  Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in\\nhis hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with\\neach a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going first made\\nsome noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and\\nseeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late then, for the\\nmoment he cried out they fired—I mean the two men, the captain wisely\\nreserving his own piece.  They had so well aimed their shot at the men\\nthey knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very\\nmuch wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and called\\neagerly for help to the other; but the captain stepping to him, told him\\nit was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his\\nvillainy, and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his\\nmusket, so that he never spoke more; there were three more in the\\ncompany, and one of them was slightly wounded.  By this time I was come;\\nand when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they\\nbegged for mercy.  The captain told them he would spare their lives if\\nthey would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery\\nthey had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in\\nrecovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from\\nwhence they came.  They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity\\nthat could be desired; and he was willing to believe them, and spare\\ntheir lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged him to keep\\nthem bound hand and foot while they were on the island.\\nWhile this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate to the boat\\nwith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they\\ndid; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for them)\\nparted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing\\nthe captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they\\nsubmitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.\\nIt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another’s\\ncircumstances.  I began first, and told him my whole history, which he\\nheard with an attention even to amazement—and particularly at the\\nwonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition;\\nand, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected\\nhim deeply.  But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I\\nseemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the\\ntears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.  After this\\ncommunication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my\\napartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the\\nhouse, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, and showed\\nthem all the contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that\\nplace.\\nAll I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above\\nall, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had\\nconcealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now planted\\nnearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,\\nwas become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in any part of\\nit but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage\\ninto it.  I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had\\na seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon\\noccasion, and I would show him that too another time; but at present our\\nbusiness was to consider how to recover the ship.  He agreed with me as\\nto that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take,\\nfor that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having\\nentered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their\\nlives to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would\\ncarry it on, knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to\\nthe gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English\\ncolonies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so\\nsmall a number as we were.\\nI mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very\\nrational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on\\nspeedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their\\nsurprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us.  Upon\\nthis, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship’s crew,\\nwondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat, would\\ncertainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that\\nthen, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he\\nallowed to be rational.  Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to\\ndo was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that they might not\\ncarry her of, and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless\\nas not to be fit to swim.  Accordingly, we went on board, took the arms\\nwhich were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found\\nthere—which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few\\nbiscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of\\ncanvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very welcome to\\nme, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for\\nmany years.\\nWhen we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, and\\nrudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great hole in\\nher bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they\\ncould not carry off the boat.  Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts\\nthat we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they\\nwent away without the boat, I did not much question to make her again fit\\nto carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the\\nSpaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.\\nCHAPTER XVIII—THE SHIP RECOVERED\\nWhile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main\\nstrength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would not\\nfloat her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her\\nbottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we\\nshould do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign\\nas a signal for the boat to come on board—but no boat stirred; and they\\nfired several times, making other signals for the boat.  At last, when\\nall their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat\\ndid not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat\\nout and row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that\\nthere were no less than ten men in her, and that they had firearms with\\nthem.\\nAs the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of\\nthem as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the\\ntide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed\\nup under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, and\\nwhere the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and\\nthe captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat,\\nof whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,\\nwere led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-powered and\\nfrightened; but that as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief\\nofficer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of\\nthe ship’s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new\\nenterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too\\npowerful for us.  I smiled at him, and told him that men in our\\ncircumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every\\ncondition that could be was better than that which we were supposed to be\\nin, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, would\\nbe sure to be a deliverance.  I asked him what he thought of the\\ncircumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth\\nventuring for?  “And where, sir,” said I, “is your belief of my being\\npreserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little\\nwhile ago?  For my part,” said I, “there seems to be but one thing amiss\\nin all the prospect of it.”  “What is that?” say he.  “Why,” said I, “it\\nis, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them\\nwhich should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew\\nI should have thought God’s providence had singled them out to deliver\\nthem into your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is\\nour own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.”  As I spoke this\\nwith a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly\\nencouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.\\nWe had, upon the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the ship,\\nconsidered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them\\neffectually.  Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than\\nordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my\\ncave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or\\ndiscovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have\\ndelivered themselves.  Here they left them bound, but gave them\\nprovisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give\\nthem their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their\\nescape they should be put to death without mercy.  They promised\\nfaithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very\\nthankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light\\nleft them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for\\ntheir comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them\\nat the entrance.\\nThe other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,\\nindeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other two\\nwere taken into my service, upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon\\ntheir solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the\\nthree honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt we\\nshould be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,\\nconsidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men\\namong them also.  As soon as they got to the place where their other boat\\nlay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling\\nthe boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they\\nwould rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the\\nshore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able\\nto seize the boat.  Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran\\nall to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great\\nsurprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a\\ngreat hole in her bottom.  After they had mused a while upon this, they\\nset up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try\\nif they could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose.\\nThen they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small\\narms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring.  But it\\nwas all one; those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those\\nin our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no\\nanswer to them.  They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that,\\nas they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to\\ntheir ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the\\nlong-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched their boat\\nagain, and got all of them on board.\\nThe captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing\\nthey would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving their comrades\\nover for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in\\nhopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the\\nother way.\\nThey had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them all\\ncoming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct, which\\nit seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in the\\nboat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for\\ntheir fellows.  This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at\\na loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no\\nadvantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they would row away to\\nthe ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail,\\nand so our recovering the ship would be lost.  However we had no remedy\\nbut to wait and see what the issue of things might present.  The seven\\nmen came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to\\na good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them;\\nso that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.  Those that\\ncame on shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little\\nhill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though\\nthey could not perceive us.  We should have been very glad if they would\\nhave come nearer us, so that we might have fired at them, or that they\\nwould have gone farther off, that we might come abroad.  But when they\\nwere come to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into\\nthe valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and where\\nthe island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary;\\nand not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one\\nanother, they sat down together under a tree to consider it.  Had they\\nthought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had\\ndone, they had done the job for us; but they were too full of\\napprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not\\ntell what the danger was they had to fear.\\nThe captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of\\ntheirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to\\nendeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon\\nthem just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they\\nwould certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.  I\\nliked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to\\ncome up to them before they could load their pieces again.  But this\\nevent did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what\\ncourse to take.  At length I told them there would be nothing done, in my\\nopinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat,\\nperhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so\\nmight use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.  We\\nwaited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were\\nvery uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw them all start up and\\nmarch down towards the sea; it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions\\nof the danger of the place that they resolved to go on board the ship\\nagain, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their\\nintended voyage with the ship.\\nAs soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as\\nit really was that they had given over their search, and were going back\\nagain; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to\\nsink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem\\nto fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle.  I\\nordered Friday and the captain’s mate to go over the little creek\\nwestward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when Friday\\nwas rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round, at about\\nhalf a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they could, and\\nwait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they\\nheard the seamen answer them, they should return it again; and then,\\nkeeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the others\\nhallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the woods as\\npossible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed\\nthem.\\nThey were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed; and\\nthey presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore westward,\\ntowards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where\\nthe water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to\\ncome up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected.  When they had set\\nthemselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a good way into the\\ncreek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of\\nthe three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the\\nboat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.\\nThis was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the\\ncaptain’s mate to their business, I took the rest with me; and, crossing\\nthe creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were\\naware—one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat.\\nThe fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start\\nup; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down;\\nand then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.\\nThey needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he\\nsaw five men upon him and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it\\nseems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest\\nof the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but\\nafterwards to join very sincerely with us.  In the meantime, Friday and\\nthe captain’s mate so well managed their business with the rest that they\\ndrew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from\\none wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left\\nthem where they were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat\\nbefore it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves\\nalso, by the time they came back to us.\\nWe had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall\\nupon them, so as to make sure work with them.  It was several hours after\\nFriday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could\\nhear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to\\nthose behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain\\nhow lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster: which was\\nvery welcome news to us.  At length they came up to the boat: but it is\\nimpossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast\\naground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.  We\\ncould hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner, telling\\none another they were got into an enchanted island; that either there\\nwere inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there\\nwere devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and\\ndevoured.  They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their\\nnames a great many times; but no answer.  After some time we could see\\nthem, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their hands like\\nmen in despair, and sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to\\nrest themselves: then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the\\nsame thing over again.  My men would fain have had me give them leave to\\nfall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them at\\nsome advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;\\nand especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men,\\nknowing the others were very well armed.  I resolved to wait, to see if\\nthey did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my\\nambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their\\nhands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not\\nbe discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they\\noffered to fire.\\nThey had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the\\nprincipal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most\\ndejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with\\ntwo more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this principal\\nrogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him\\ncome so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before:\\nbut when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their\\nfeet, let fly at them.  The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next\\nman was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die\\ntill an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.  At the noise of the\\nfire I immediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,\\nviz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain\\nand his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with\\narms.  We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see\\nour number; and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now one\\nof us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley,\\nand so perhaps might reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we\\ndesired: for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was,\\nthey would be very willing to capitulate.  So he calls out as loud as he\\ncould to one of them, “Tom Smith!  Tom Smith!”  Tom Smith answered\\nimmediately, “Is that Robinson?” for it seems he knew the voice.  The\\nother answered, “Ay, ay; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms\\nand yield, or you are all dead men this moment.”  “Who must we yield to?\\nWhere are they?” says Smith again.  “Here they are,” says he; “here’s our\\ncaptain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours;\\nthe boatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if\\nyou do not yield you are all lost.”  “Will they give us quarter, then?”\\nsays Tom Smith, “and we will yield.”  “I’ll go and ask, if you promise to\\nyield,” said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain himself\\nthen calls out, “You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down your arms\\nimmediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.”\\nUpon this Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s sake, captain, give me\\nquarter; what have I done?  They have all been as bad as I:” which, by\\nthe way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man\\nthat laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him\\nbarbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.\\nHowever, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,\\nand trust to the governor’s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all\\ncalled me governor.  In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged\\ntheir lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two\\nmore, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,\\nwith those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,\\nand upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight\\nfor reasons of state.\\nOur next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and\\nas for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he\\nexpostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him, and\\nupon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must\\nbring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.\\nThey all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives.  As for\\nthat, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the commander’s of\\nthe island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren,\\nuninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct them that it was\\ninhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang\\nthem all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he\\nsupposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice\\nrequired, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise\\nto prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning.\\nThough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired\\neffect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with\\nthe governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God’s\\nsake, that they might not be sent to England.\\nIt now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and that\\nit would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in\\ngetting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that\\nthey might not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the\\ncaptain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the men was\\nordered to speak again, and say to the captain, “Captain, the commander\\ncalls for you;” and presently the captain replied, “Tell his excellency I\\nam just coming.”  This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed\\nthat the commander was just by, with his fifty men.  Upon the captain\\ncoming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked\\nwonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next morning.\\nBut, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I\\ntold him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take\\nAtkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the\\ncave where the others lay.  This was committed to Friday and the two men\\nwho came on shore with the captain.  They conveyed them to the cave as to\\na prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their\\ncondition.  The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I\\nhave given a full description: and as it was fenced in, and they\\npinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were upon their\\nbehaviour.\\nTo these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a\\nparley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought\\nthey might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship.  He\\ntalked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought\\nto, and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives\\nas to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England they\\nwould all be hanged in chains; but that if they would join in so just an\\nattempt as to recover the ship, he would have the governor’s engagement\\nfor their pardon.\\nAny one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in\\ntheir condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and\\npromised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to\\nhim to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and\\nwould go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a father\\nto them as long as they lived.  “Well,” says the captain, “I must go and\\ntell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to\\nconsent to it.”  So he brought me an account of the temper he found them\\nin, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.  However, that we\\nmight be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out\\nthose five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that\\nhe would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the governor\\nwould keep the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the\\ncastle (my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if\\nthey proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be\\nhanged in chains alive on the shore.  This looked severe, and convinced\\nthem that the governor was in earnest; however, they had no way left them\\nbut to accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much\\nas of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.\\nOur strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the captain,\\nhis mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the first gang, to\\nwhom, having their character from the captain, I had given their liberty,\\nand trusted them with arms; third, the other two that I had kept till now\\nin my bower, pinioned, but on the captain’s motion had now released;\\nfourth, these five released at last; so that there were twelve in all,\\nbesides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.\\nI asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on\\nboard the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was\\nproper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was\\nemployment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with\\nvictuals.  As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but\\nFriday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries; and\\nI made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday\\nwas to take them.\\nWhen I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who\\ntold them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;\\nand that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but\\nby my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle,\\nand be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me as\\ngovernor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor,\\nthe garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.\\nThe captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two\\nboats, stop the breach of one, and man them.  He made his passenger\\ncaptain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five\\nmore, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well, for\\nthey came up to the ship about midnight.  As soon as they came within\\ncall of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had\\nbrought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they\\nhad found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to\\nthe ship’s side; when the captain and the mate entering first with their\\narms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the\\nbutt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;\\nthey secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and\\nbegan to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below; when the\\nother boat and their men, entering at the forechains, secured the\\nforecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the\\ncook-room, making three men they found there prisoners.  When this was\\ndone, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three\\nmen, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who,\\nhaving taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got\\nfirearms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the\\ndoor, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded\\nthe mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of\\nthe men, but killed nobody.  The mate, calling for help, rushed, however,\\ninto the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the\\nnew captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came\\nout again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more:\\nupon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without\\nany more lives lost.\\nAs soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to\\nbe fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of\\nhis success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat\\nwatching upon the shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning.\\nHaving thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been\\na day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised\\nwith the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me\\nby the name of “Governor!  Governor!” and presently I knew the captain’s\\nvoice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and,\\npointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms, “My dear friend and\\ndeliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship; for she is all yours, and so are\\nwe, and all that belong to her.”  I cast my eyes to the ship, and there\\nshe rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had\\nweighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather\\nbeing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the\\nlittle creek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace\\nin near the place where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just\\nat my door.  I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I\\nsaw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy,\\nand a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go.  At\\nfirst, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but as he\\nhad taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to\\nthe ground.  He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle\\nout of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on\\npurpose for me.  After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and\\nthough it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could\\nspeak a word to him.  All this time the poor man was in as great an\\necstasy as I, only not under any surprise as I was; and he said a\\nthousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself;\\nbut such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits\\ninto confusion: at last it broke out into tears, and in a little while\\nafter I recovered my speech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my\\ndeliverer, and we rejoiced together.  I told him I looked upon him as a\\nman sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed\\nto be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the testimonies\\nwe had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an\\nevidence that the eye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest\\ncorner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.\\nI forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what\\nheart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner\\nprovided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition,\\nbut from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.\\nWhen we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some\\nlittle refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches\\nthat had been so long his masters had not plundered him of.  Upon this,\\nhe called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore\\nthat were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had\\nbeen one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had been\\nto dwell upon the island still.  First, he had brought me a case of\\nbottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira\\nwine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good\\ntobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork,\\nwith a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also\\nbrought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two\\nbottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things.  But besides these,\\nand what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six new\\nclean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of\\nshoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes\\nof his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me\\nfrom head to foot.  It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one\\nmay imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never was anything in the\\nworld of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to\\nwear such clothes at first.\\nAfter these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were\\nbrought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done\\nwith the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we might\\nventure to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew\\nto be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain\\nsaid he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and\\nif he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be\\ndelivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come to;\\nand I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it.  Upon\\nthis, I told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the\\ntwo men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave\\nthem upon the island.  “I should be very glad of that,” says the captain,\\n“with all my heart.”  “Well,” says I, “I will send for them up and talk\\nwith them for you.”  So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they\\nwere now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I\\nsay, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned\\nas they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came.  After some\\ntime, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called\\ngovernor again.  Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men\\nto be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of\\ntheir villainous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with\\nthe ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies, but that\\nProvidence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen\\ninto the pit which they had dug for others.  I let them know that by my\\ndirection the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and\\nthey might see by-and-by that their new captain had received the reward\\nof his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm;\\nthat, as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I should not\\nexecute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by my commission they could\\nnot doubt but I had authority so to do.\\nOne of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to\\nsay but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their\\nlives, and they humbly implored my mercy.  But I told them I knew not\\nwhat mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the\\nisland with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to\\nEngland; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England other\\nthan as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with\\nthe ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the\\ngallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had\\na mind to take their fate in the island.  If they desired that, as I had\\nliberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give them their\\nlives, if they thought they could shift on shore.  They seemed very\\nthankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to stay there\\nthan be carried to England to be hanged.  So I left it on that issue.\\nHowever, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he durst\\nnot leave them there.  Upon this I seemed a little angry with the\\ncaptain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that\\nseeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word;\\nand that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at\\nliberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might take them\\nagain if he could catch them.  Upon this they appeared very thankful, and\\nI accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods,\\nto the place whence they came, and I would leave them some firearms, some\\nammunition, and some directions how they should live very well if they\\nthought fit.  Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the\\ncaptain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to\\ngo on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the\\nboat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the\\nnew captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men\\nmight see him.\\nWhen the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,\\nand entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.  I\\ntold them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain had\\ncarried them away they would certainly be hanged.  I showed them the new\\ncaptain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had\\nnothing less to expect.\\nWhen they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them I\\nwould let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the\\nway of making it easy to them.  Accordingly, I gave them the whole\\nhistory of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my\\nfortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my\\ngrapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.  I told\\nthem the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected,\\nfor whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common\\nwith themselves.  Here it may be noted that the captain, who had ink on\\nboard, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of making ink of\\ncharcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done things much more\\ndifficult.\\nI left them my firearms—viz. five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and\\nthree swords.  I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after\\nthe first year or two I used but little, and wasted none.  I gave them a\\ndescription of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and\\nfatten them, and to make both butter and cheese.  In a word, I gave them\\nevery part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the\\ncaptain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some\\ngarden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of.  Also, I\\ngave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and\\nbade them be sure to sow and increase them.\\nCHAPTER XIX—RETURN TO ENGLAND\\nHaving done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the\\nship.  We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.\\nThe next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship’s\\nside, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged\\nto be taken into the ship for God’s sake, for they should be murdered,\\nand begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them\\nimmediately.  Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without\\nme; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of\\namendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly\\nwhipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest and quiet\\nfellows.\\nSome time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,\\nwith the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my\\nintercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they\\ntook, and were very thankful for.  I also encouraged them, by telling\\nthem that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I\\nwould not forget them.\\nWhen I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the\\ngreat goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also,\\nI forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me\\nso long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly\\npass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the\\nmoney I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.  And thus I left the\\nisland, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship’s account, in the\\nyear 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months,\\nand nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity the same\\nday of the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat from among\\nthe Moors of Sallee.  In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in\\nEngland the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years\\nabsent.\\nWhen I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if\\nI had never been known there.  My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I\\nhad left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes\\nin the world; was become a widow the second time, and very low in the\\nworld.  I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would\\ngive her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former\\ncare and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would\\nafford; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for\\nher; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to me;\\nnor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be\\nobserved in its proper place.  I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but\\nmy father was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except that\\nI found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers; and\\nas I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision\\nmade for me; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me;\\nand that the little money I had would not do much for me as to settling\\nin the world.\\nI met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and\\nthis was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,\\nand by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very\\nhandsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of\\nthe men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other\\nmerchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment\\nupon the subject, and a present of almost £200 sterling.\\nBut after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,\\nand how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I\\nresolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some information\\nof the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of\\nmy partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me\\nover for dead.  With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I\\narrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very honestly\\nin all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all\\noccasions.  When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my\\nparticular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship who first\\ntook me up at sea off the shore of Africa.  He was now grown old, and had\\nleft off going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man,\\ninto his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.  The old man did not\\nknow me, and indeed I hardly knew him.  But I soon brought him to my\\nremembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told\\nhim who I was.\\nAfter some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I\\ninquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner.  The old\\nman told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that\\nhe could assure me that when he came away my partner was living, but the\\ntrustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my part were\\nboth dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very good account of\\nthe improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general belief of\\nmy being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of\\nthe produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who\\nhad appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the\\nking, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended\\nfor the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the\\nCatholic faith: but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the\\ninheritance, it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual\\nproduction, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored:\\nbut he assured me that the steward of the king’s revenue from lands, and\\nthe providore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all\\nalong that the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a\\nfaithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my\\nmoiety.  I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had\\nbrought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking\\nafter; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any\\nobstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety.  He told me he\\ncould not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but\\nthis he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying\\nhis part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard\\nthat the king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to\\nsome other monastery or religious house, amounted to above two hundred\\nmoidores a year: that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of\\nit, there was no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to\\nwitness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the\\ncountry; also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very\\nfair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only\\nhave their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very\\nconsiderable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the\\nproduce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was\\ngiven up, as above; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.\\nI showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and\\ninquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should\\nthus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had\\nmade him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.\\nHe told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being\\ndead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should come\\nof my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing\\nso remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his\\nclaim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he\\nwould have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so\\nthey call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the\\nBrazils, orders to do it.  “But,” says the old man, “I have one piece of\\nnews to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the\\nrest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing\\nso also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with me, in your\\nname, for the first six or eight years’ profits, which I received.  There\\nbeing at that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building\\nan ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as\\nafterwards it produced; however,” says the old man, “I shall give you a\\ntrue account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of\\nit.”\\nAfter a few days’ further conference with this ancient friend, he brought\\nme an account of the first six years’ income of my plantation, signed by\\nmy partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods,\\nviz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c.,\\nwhich is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account,\\nthat every year the income considerably increased; but, as above, the\\ndisbursements being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old\\nman let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores\\nof gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of\\ntobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming\\nhome to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having the place.  The good\\nman then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been\\nobliged to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a\\nshare in a new ship.  “However, my old friend,” says he, “you shall not\\nwant a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son returns you shall\\nbe fully satisfied.”  Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me\\none hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings\\nof his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of\\nwhich he was quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them both\\ninto my hands for security of the rest.\\nI was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be\\nable to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had\\ntaken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions,\\nand particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly\\nrefrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if his\\ncircumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it\\nwould not straiten him?  He told me he could not say but it might\\nstraiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might want it\\nmore than he.\\nEverything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly\\nrefrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the\\nmoidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:\\nthen I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of\\nthe plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I\\nafterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son’s\\nship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I\\nfound he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to\\nreceive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more\\nfrom him.\\nWhen this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a\\nmethod to make my claim to my plantation.  I told him I thought to go\\nover to it myself.  He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I did\\nnot, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to\\nappropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river\\nof Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a\\npublic register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was\\nalive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the\\nplanting the said plantation at first.  This being regularly attested by\\na notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a\\nletter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;\\nand then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return.\\nNever was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this\\nprocuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from\\nthe survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to\\nsea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers\\nenclosed:—\\nFirst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or\\nplantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old\\nPortugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one\\nthousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.\\nSecondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the\\neffects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration,\\nas being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called civil\\ndeath; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,\\namounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being\\nabout three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.\\nThirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine’s account, who had received\\nthe profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to account for\\nwhat was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight\\nhundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged\\nto my account: as to the king’s part, that refunded nothing.\\nThere was a letter of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately\\nupon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved,\\nand what it produced a year; with the particulars of the number of\\nsquares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there\\nwere upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he\\nhad said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was\\nalive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of\\nmy own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver\\nmy effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of\\nhis friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a present seven\\nfine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by\\nsome other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a\\nbetter voyage than I.  He sent me also five chests of excellent\\nsweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as\\nmoidores.  By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me one\\nthousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and\\nthe rest of the whole account in gold.\\nI might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than\\nthe beginning.  It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very\\nheart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come\\nall in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods:\\nand the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my\\nhand.  In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man\\nrun and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had\\noverset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I continued\\nvery ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and\\nsomething of the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered me to\\nbe let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: but I verily\\nbelieve, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the\\nspirits, I should have died.\\nI was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds sterling\\nin money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of\\nabove a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England:\\nand, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to\\nunderstand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it.  The first\\nthing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old\\ncaptain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me\\nin my beginning, and honest to me at the end.  I showed him all that was\\nsent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which\\ndisposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to\\nreward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned to him\\nthe hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary, and\\ncaused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four\\nhundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in\\nthe fullest and firmest manner possible.  After which I caused a\\nprocuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual\\nprofits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to account with him,\\nand make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a\\nclause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him\\nduring his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son\\nafter him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.\\nI had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do\\nwith the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,\\nI had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life in the\\nisland where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I\\nwanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how\\nto secure it.  I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where\\nit might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished\\nbefore anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to\\nput it, or whom to trust with it.  My old patron, the captain, indeed,\\nwas honest, and that was the only refuge I had.  In the next place, my\\ninterest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I could not\\ntell how to think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and\\nleft my effects in some safe hands behind me.  At first I thought of my\\nold friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but\\nthen she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in\\ndebt: so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself\\nand take my effects with me.\\nIt was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and, therefore,\\nas I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had\\nbeen my former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose\\nhusband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power,\\nmy faithful steward and instructor.  So, the first thing I did, I got a\\nmerchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only to\\npay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred\\npounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by\\ntelling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply: at the same\\ntime I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they\\nbeing, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one having\\nbeen married and left a widow; and the other having a husband not so kind\\nto her as he should be.  But among all my relations or acquaintances I\\ncould not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my\\nstock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind\\nme; and this greatly perplexed me.\\nI had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself\\nthere, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some\\nlittle scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back.\\nHowever, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the\\npresent; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of\\nthe country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only\\nthat, now and then, having of late thought more of it than formerly, when\\nI began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret having\\nprofessed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best religion\\nto die with.\\nBut, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going\\nto the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my\\neffects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if I\\narrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find some\\nrelations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to\\ngo to England with all my wealth.\\nIn order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet\\nbeing just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just and\\nfaithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the Prior of\\nSt. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and\\nthe offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were\\nundisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the\\nmonastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior\\nshould direct; desiring the good padre’s prayers for me, and the like.  I\\nwrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the\\nacknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for\\nsending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of it.\\nLastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the\\nimproving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of\\nthe works; giving him instructions for his future government of my part,\\naccording to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired\\nhim to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me more\\nparticularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to\\nhim, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.  To this I\\nadded a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two\\ndaughters, for such the captain’s son informed me he had; with two pieces\\nof fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces\\nof black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value.\\nHaving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects\\ninto good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to\\nEngland: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange\\naversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and yet I could give\\nno reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that\\nthough I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my\\nmind, and that not once but two or three times.\\nIt is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of\\nthe reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own\\nthoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled\\nout to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having\\nput my things on board one of them, and in the other having agreed with\\nthe captain; I say two of these ships miscarried.  One was taken by the\\nAlgerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near Torbay, and all the\\npeople drowned except three; so that in either of those vessels I had\\nbeen made miserable.\\nHaving been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I\\ncommunicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but\\neither to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to\\nRochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to\\nParis, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the\\nway by land through France.  In a word, I was so prepossessed against my\\ngoing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to\\ntravel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not\\nvalue the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to make it more so,\\nmy old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in\\nLisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up two\\nmore English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last\\ngoing to Paris only; so that in all there were six of us and five\\nservants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese, contenting themselves\\nwith one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got an\\nEnglish sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who\\nwas too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant\\non the road.\\nIn this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well\\nmounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour\\nto call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as because I\\nhad two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.\\nAs I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble\\nyou now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that happened\\nto us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.\\nWhen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were\\nwilling to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth\\nobserving; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away,\\nand set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we came to\\nthe edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with\\nan account that so much snow was falling on the French side of the\\nmountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to\\nPampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.\\nWhen we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me, that\\nhad been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could\\nscarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor, indeed, was\\nit more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of Old\\nCastile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot, and\\nimmediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so\\nseverely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing and\\nperishing of our fingers and toes.\\nPoor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered\\nwith snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before\\nin his life.  To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued\\nsnowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter\\nwas come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before,\\nwere now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places\\ntoo thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in\\nthe northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of\\nbeing buried alive every step.  We stayed no less than twenty days at\\nPampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its\\nbeing better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had\\nbeen known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should go away to\\nFontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little\\nvoyage.  But, while I was considering this, there came in four French\\ngentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as\\nwe were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the\\ncountry near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains\\nby such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow; for where\\nthey met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough\\nto bear them and their horses.  We sent for this guide, who told us he\\nwould undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow,\\nprovided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild\\nbeasts; for, he said, in these great snows it was frequent for some\\nwolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made\\nravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow.  We told\\nhim we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if he\\nwould insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we\\nwere in most danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains.\\nHe satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we\\nwere to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other\\ngentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said,\\nhad attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.\\nAccordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of\\nNovember; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he\\ncame directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,\\nabout twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the\\nplain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the\\ncountry was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning\\nto his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is\\ntrue the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours,\\nsuch meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed\\nthe height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow;\\nand all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of\\nLanguedoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing, though at a great\\ndistance, and we had some rough way to pass still.\\nWe were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day\\nand a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we\\nshould soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend\\nevery day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon our\\nguide, we went on.\\nIt was about two hours before night when, our guide being something\\nbefore us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and\\nafter them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two of\\nthe wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would\\nhave been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them fastened\\nupon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that\\nhe had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but\\nhallooed and cried out to us most lustily.  My man Friday being next me,\\nI bade him ride up and see what was the matter.  As soon as Friday came\\nin sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, “O master! O\\nmaster!” but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and\\nwith his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him.\\nIt was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having been\\nused to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went\\nclose up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have fired\\nat a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf or\\nendangered shooting the man.\\nBut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it\\nalarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday’s pistol, we\\nheard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,\\nredoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had\\nbeen a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few as\\nthat we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this\\nwolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately,\\nand fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his\\nhead, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth.  But the man\\nwas most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the\\narm, and the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made\\nsome defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his horse,\\nwhen Friday came up and shot the wolf.\\nIt is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday’s pistol we all mended\\nour pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would\\ngive us leave, to see what was the matter.  As soon as we came clear of\\nthe trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the\\ncase, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not\\npresently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.\\nCHAPTER XX—FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR\\nBut never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner\\nas that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all,\\nthough at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest\\ndiversion imaginable.  As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does\\nnot gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two\\nparticular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions; first,\\nas to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them,\\nexcept they first attack him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it\\nis probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with snow),\\nif you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but then you\\nmust take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is\\na very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince;\\nnay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and\\nkeep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look\\nsteadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss\\nanything at him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger,\\nhe thinks himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his\\nrevenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honour—that is his first\\nquality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you,\\nnight or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate\\ntill he overtakes you.\\nMy man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him he was\\nhelping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, when\\non a sudden we espied the bear come out of the wood; and a monstrous one\\nit was, the biggest by far that ever I saw.  We were all a little\\nsurprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see\\njoy and courage in the fellow’s countenance.  “O! O! O!” says Friday,\\nthree times, pointing to him; “O master, you give me te leave, me shakee\\nte hand with him; me makee you good laugh.”\\nI was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased.  “You fool,” says I,\\n“he will eat you up.”—“Eatee me up! eatee me up!” says Friday, twice over\\nagain; “me eatee him up; me makee you good laugh; you all stay here, me\\nshow you good laugh.”  So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a\\nmoment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear,\\nand which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and\\nwith his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.\\nThe bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, till\\nFriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand\\nhim.  “Hark ye, hark ye,” says Friday, “me speakee with you.”  We\\nfollowed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the\\nmountains, we were entered a vast forest, where the country was plain and\\npretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there.\\nFriday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him\\nquickly, and took up a great stone, and threw it at him, and hit him just\\non the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a\\nwall; but it answered Friday’s end, for the rogue was so void of fear\\nthat he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh\\nas he called it.  As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he\\nturns about and comes after him, taking very long strides, and shuffling\\non at a strange rate, so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop;\\naway reins Friday, and takes his course as if he ran towards us for help;\\nso we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man;\\nthough I was angry at him for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was\\ngoing about his own business another way; and especially I was angry that\\nhe had turned the bear upon us, and then ran away; and I called out, “You\\ndog! is this your making us laugh?  Come away, and take your horse, that\\nwe may shoot the creature.”  He heard me, and cried out, “No shoot, no\\nshoot; stand still, and you get much laugh:” and as the nimble creature\\nran two feet for the bear’s one, he turned on a sudden on one side of us,\\nand seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to\\nfollow; and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the tree, laying his gun\\ndown upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of the\\ntree.  The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance: the\\nfirst thing he did he stopped at the gun, smelt at it, but let it lie,\\nand up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so\\nmonstrous heavy.  I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man,\\nand could not for my life see anything to laugh at, till seeing the bear\\nget up the tree, we all rode near to him.\\nWhen we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a\\nlarge branch, and the bear got about half-way to him.  As soon as the\\nbear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, “Ha!”\\nsays he to us, “now you see me teachee the bear dance:” so he began\\njumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but\\nstood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get back;\\nthen, indeed, we did laugh heartily.  But Friday had not done with him by\\na great deal; when seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as\\nif he had supposed the bear could speak English, “What, you come no\\nfarther? pray you come farther;” so he left jumping and shaking the tree;\\nand the bear, just as if he understood what he said, did come a little\\nfarther; then he began jumping again, and the bear stopped again.  We\\nthought now was a good time to knock him in the head, and called to\\nFriday to stand still and we should shoot the bear: but he cried out\\nearnestly, “Oh, pray!  Oh, pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then:” he\\nwould have said by-and-by.  However, to shorten the story, Friday danced\\nso much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, but\\nstill could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he\\ndepended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was too cunning\\nfor that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down, but\\nclung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not\\nimagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last.\\nBut Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to\\nthe bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther, “Well,\\nwell,” says Friday, “you no come farther, me go; you no come to me, me\\ncome to you;” and upon this he went out to the smaller end, where it\\nwould bend with his weight, and gently let himself down by it, sliding\\ndown the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his feet, and\\naway he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood still.  “Well,” said I to\\nhim, “Friday, what will you do now?  Why don’t you shoot him?”  “No\\nshoot,” says Friday, “no yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you\\none more laugh:” and, indeed, so he did; for when the bear saw his enemy\\ngone, he came back from the bough, where he stood, but did it very\\ncautiously, looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he\\ngot into the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder end foremost,\\nhe came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at\\na time, very leisurely.  At this juncture, and just before he could set\\nhis hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the\\nmuzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead.  Then the rogue\\nturned about to see if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased\\nby our looks, he began to laugh very loud.  “So we kill bear in my\\ncountry,” says Friday.  “So you kill them?” says I; “why, you have no\\nguns.”—“No,” says he, “no gun, but shoot great much long arrow.”  This\\nwas a good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our\\nguide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of\\nwolves ran much in my head; and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on\\nthe shore of Africa, of which I have said something already, I never\\nheard anything that filled me with so much horror.\\nThese things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as\\nFriday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this\\nmonstrous creature off, which was worth saving; but we had near three\\nleagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and went\\nforward on our journey.\\nThe ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous\\nas on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,\\nwere come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to\\nseek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages,\\nwhere they surprised the country people, killed a great many of their\\nsheep and horses, and some people too.\\nWe had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us if there were\\nmore wolves in the country we should find them there; and this was a\\nsmall plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long, narrow\\ndefile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then\\nwe should come to the village where we were to lodge.\\nIt was within half-an-hour of sunset when we entered the wood, and a\\nlittle after sunset when we came into the plain: we met with nothing in\\nthe first wood, except that in a little plain within the wood, which was\\nnot above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross the road,\\nfull speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of some\\nprey, and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were gone out\\nof sight in a few moments.  Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was\\nbut a fainthearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he\\nbelieved there were more wolves a-coming.  We kept our arms ready, and\\nour eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through that\\nwood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain.  As soon as\\nwe came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us.  The\\nfirst object we met with was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse\\nwhich the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work, we\\ncould not say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had\\neaten up all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at\\ntheir feast, neither did they take much notice of us.  Friday would have\\nlet fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we\\nwere like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware of.\\nWe had not gone half over the plain when we began to hear the wolves\\nhowl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after\\nwe saw about a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and\\nmost of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced\\nofficers.  I scarce knew in what manner to receive them, but found to\\ndraw ourselves in a close line was the only way; so we formed in a\\nmoment; but that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that\\nonly every other man should fire, and that the others, who had not\\nfired, should stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if\\nthey continued to advance upon us; and then that those that had fired at\\nfirst should not pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready,\\nevery one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair\\nof pistols each man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six\\nvolleys, half of us at a time; however, at present we had no necessity;\\nfor upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being\\nterrified as well with the noise as with the fire.  Four of them being\\nshot in the head, dropped; several others were wounded, and went\\nbleeding off, as we could see by the snow.  I found they stopped, but\\ndid not immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that I had been told\\nthat the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I\\ncaused all the company to halloo as loud as they could; and I found the\\nnotion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout they began to retire\\nand turn about.  I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their\\nrear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.\\nThis gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and that we might lose\\nno time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded our\\nfusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise\\nin the same wood on our left, only that it was farther onward, the same\\nway we were to go.\\nThe night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made it\\nworse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive\\nthat it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on a\\nsudden we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind\\nus, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them:\\nhowever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast\\nas we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only\\na good hard trot.  In this manner, we came in view of the entrance of a\\nwood, through which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain;\\nbut we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the lane or pass, we\\nsaw a confused number of wolves standing just at the entrance.  On a\\nsudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and\\nlooking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him,\\nflying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, full\\nspeed: the horse had the advantage of them; but as we supposed that he\\ncould not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with\\nhim at last: no question but they did.\\nBut here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance\\nwhere the horse came out, we found the carcasses of another horse and of\\ntwo men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men was no\\ndoubt the same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by\\nhim fired off; but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body\\nwas eaten up.  This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to\\ntake; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us\\npresently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were three\\nhundred of them.  It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the\\nentrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large\\ntimber-trees, which had been cut down the summer before, and I suppose\\nlay there for carriage.  I drew my little troop in among those trees, and\\nplacing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to\\nalight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a\\ntriangle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.  We did\\nso, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious charge than the\\ncreatures made upon us in this place.  They came on with a growling kind\\nof noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our\\nbreastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury\\nof theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our\\nhorses behind us.  I ordered our men to fire as before, every other man;\\nand they took their aim so sure that they killed several of the wolves at\\nthe first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual firing,\\nfor they came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before.\\nWhen we had fired a second volley of our fusees, we thought they stopped\\na little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but a moment,\\nfor others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols;\\nand I believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen\\nof them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came on again.  I was loth to\\nspend our shot too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday,\\nfor he was better employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable,\\nhe had charged my fusee and his own while we were engaged—but, as I said,\\nI called my other man, and giving him a horn of powder, I had him lay a\\ntrain all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train.  He did\\nso, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came up to it, and\\nsome got upon it, when I, snapping an unchanged pistol close to the\\npowder, set it on fire; those that were upon the timber were scorched\\nwith it, and six or seven of them fell; or rather jumped in among us with\\nthe force and fright of the fire; we despatched these in an instant, and\\nthe rest were so frightened with the light, which the night—for it was\\nnow very near dark—made more terrible that they drew back a little; upon\\nwhich I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and after\\nthat we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied\\nimmediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the\\nground, and fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our\\nexpectation, for the crying and howling they made was better understood\\nby their fellows; so that they all fled and left us.\\nWe had, first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it been\\ndaylight we had killed many more.  The field of battle being thus\\ncleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.  We\\nheard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went\\nseveral times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow\\ndazzling our eyes, we were not certain.  In about an hour more we came to\\nthe town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright and\\nall in arms; for, it seems, the night before the wolves and some bears\\nhad broken into the village, and put them in such terror that they were\\nobliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the night, to\\npreserve their cattle, and indeed their people.\\nThe next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with\\nthe rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were\\nobliged to take a new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a\\nwarm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor\\nanything like them; but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us\\nit was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of\\nthe mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they\\ninquired much what kind of guide we had got who would venture to bring us\\nthat way in such a severe season, and told us it was surprising we were\\nnot all devoured.  When we told them how we placed ourselves and the\\nhorses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was\\nfifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was the sight of the\\nhorses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at\\nother times they are really afraid of a gun; but being excessively\\nhungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses\\nhad made them senseless of danger, and that if we had not by the\\ncontinual fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder,\\nmastered them, it had been great odds but that we had been torn to\\npieces; whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and\\nfired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their\\nown, when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal, they told us\\nthat at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would\\nhave been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come off\\nsafe, especially having our firearms in our hands, being so many in\\nnumber.  For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for,\\nseeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour\\nus, and having nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over\\nfor lost; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those\\nmountains again: I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by\\nsea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a-week.\\nI have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through\\nFrance—nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with\\nmuch more advantage than I can.  I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and\\nwithout any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover\\nthe 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.\\nI was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all\\nmy new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which I\\nbrought with me having been currently paid.\\nMy principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,\\nin gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much nor\\ncare too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely that I was\\nperfectly easy as to the security of my effects; and, indeed, I was very\\nhappy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity\\nof this good gentlewoman.\\nAnd now, having resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, I\\nwrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who, having offered it to the two\\nmerchants, the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they\\naccepted the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to\\na correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.\\nIn return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent\\nfrom Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange\\nfor thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate,\\nreserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year to him (the old man)\\nduring his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life,\\nwhich I had promised them, and which the plantation was to make good as a\\nrent-charge.  And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune\\nand adventure—a life of Providence’s chequer-work, and of a variety which\\nthe world will seldom be able to show the like of; beginning foolishly,\\nbut closing much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so\\nmuch as to hope for.\\nAny one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune I was\\npast running any more hazards—and so, indeed, I had been, if other\\ncircumstances had concurred; but I was inured to a wandering life, had no\\nfamily, nor many relations; nor, however rich, had I contracted fresh\\nacquaintance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could\\nnot keep that country out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the\\nwing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination I had to\\nsee my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards were in being there.  My\\ntrue friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far\\nprevailed with me, that for almost seven years she prevented my running\\nabroad, during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of\\nmy brothers, into my care; the eldest, having something of his own, I\\nbred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his\\nestate after my decease.  The other I placed with the captain of a ship;\\nand after five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young\\nfellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young\\nfellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to further adventures\\nmyself.\\nIn the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I\\nmarried, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and\\nhad three children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and my\\nnephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my\\ninclination to go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me\\nto go in his ship as a private trader to the East Indies; this was in the\\nyear 1694.\\nIn this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my successors\\nthe Spaniards, had the old story of their lives and of the villains I\\nleft there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they\\nafterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the\\nSpaniards were obliged to use violence with them; how they were subjected\\nto the Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them—a history, if it\\nwere entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own\\npart—particularly, also, as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who\\nlanded several times upon the island, and as to the improvement they made\\nupon the island itself, and how five of them made an attempt upon the\\nmainland, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which,\\nat my coming, I found about twenty young children on the island.\\nHere I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary\\nthings, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two\\nworkmen, which I had brought from England with me, viz. a carpenter and a\\nsmith.\\nBesides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to myself\\nthe property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively as they\\nagreed on; and having settled all things with them, and engaged them not\\nto leave the place, I left them there.\\nFrom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which I\\nbought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides other\\nsupplies, I sent seven women, being such as I found proper for service,\\nor for wives to such as would take them.  As to the Englishmen, I\\npromised to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of\\nnecessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting—which I\\nafterwards could not perform.  The fellows proved very honest and\\ndiligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for\\nthem.  I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows, three of them\\nbeing big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again\\nwere considerably increased.\\nBut all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came\\nand invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with\\nthat whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them\\nkilled; but at last, a storm destroying their enemies’ canoes, they\\nfamished or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the\\npossession of their plantation, and still lived upon the island.\\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new\\nadventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a farther account\\nof in the Second Part of my Story.\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON\\nCRUSOE***\\n******* This file should be named 521-0.txt or 521-0.zip *******\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/5/2/521\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\nFor additional contact information:\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
